Indeed alternative start codons exist, and are translated by the cells'machinery by a Methionine (M). By default AGAT translates the first codon as other codons by the corresponding AA. If you wish to translate the first codon by a M when it is a valid alternative start codon, activate this parameter. If the sequence you try to translate is a CDS (or starting by a CDS), the phase is checked and the alternative start codon is accepted only if the phase is 0."},{"names":["--cdna"],"argument":"","description":"Boolean - This extract the cdna sequence (i.e reverse complement of the mRNA: transcribed sequence (devoid of introns, but containing untranslated exons, then reverse complemented).
