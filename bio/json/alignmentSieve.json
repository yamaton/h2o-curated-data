A positive value shift an end to the right (on the + strand) and a negative value shifts a fragment to the left. Either 2 or 4 integers can be provided. For example, \"2 -3\" will shift the left-most fragment end two bases to the right and the right-most end 3 bases to the left. If 4 integers are provided, then the first and last two refer to fragments whose read 1 is on the left or right, respectively. Consequently, it is possible to take strand into consideration for strand-specific protocols. A fragment whose length falls below 1 due to shifting will not be written to the output. See the online documentation for graphical examples. Note that non-properly-paired reads will be filtered."},{"names":["--ATACshift"],"argument":"","description":"Shift the produced BAM file or BEDPE regions as commonly done for ATAC-seq.
