This determines if Read 1 of a paired-end end file, or single-end files, are trimmed for PolyA or PolyT. In case of paired-end sequencing, Read2 is trimmed for the complementary base from the start of the reads.

Sequences which were merely trimmed because of poor quality will not be shortened further. Read 2 of paired-end libraries will in addition have the first 2 bp removed from the 5' end (by setting '--clip_r2 2').
