    argument: (elp)
    description: Detailed help
  - names:
      - -database
    argument: ""
    description: The name of the sequence database to run an analysis on. This is the name that was provided to the BuildDatabase script using the "-name" option.
  - names:
      - -pa
    argument: '#'
    description: Specify the number of parallel search jobs to run. RMBlast jobs will use 4 cores each and ABBlast jobs will use a single core each. i.e. on a machine with 12 cores and running with RMBlast you would use -pa 3 to fully utilize the machine.
  - names:
      - -recoverDir
    argument: <Previous Output Directory>
    description: If a run fails in the middle of processing, it may be possible recover some results and continue where the previous run left off. Simply supply the output directory where the results of the failed run were saved and the program will attempt to recover and continue the run.
  - names:
      - -srand
    argument: '#'
    description: Optionally set the seed of the random number generator to a known value before the batches are randomly selected ( using Fisher Yates Shuffling ). This is only useful if you need to reproduce the sample choice between runs. This should be an integer number.
