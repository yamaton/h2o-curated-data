    description: 'Annotation(s) file you would like to use to complement the reference annotation. You can specify as much file you want like so: -a addfile1 -a addfile2 -a addfile3 /!\ The order you provide these files matter. Once the reference file has been complemented by file1, this new annotation becomes the new reference that will be complemented by file2 etc. /!\ The result with -a addfile1 -a addfile2 will differ to the result from -a addfile2 -a addfile1. So, be aware of what you want if you use several addfiles.'
