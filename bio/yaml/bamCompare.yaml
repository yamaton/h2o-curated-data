    argument: '{readCount,SES,None}'
    description: 'Method to use to scale the samples. If a method is specified, then it will be used to compensate for sequencing depth differences between the samples. As an alternative, this can be set to None and an option from --normalizeUsing <method> can be used. (Default: readCount)'

      - --sampleLength
      - -l
    argument: SAMPLELENGTH
    description: '*Only relevant when SES is chosen for the scaleFactorsMethod.* To compute the SES, specify the length (in bases) of the regions (see --numberOfSamples) that will be randomly sampled to calculate the scaling factors. If you do not have a good sequencing depth for your samples consider increasing the sampling regions'' size to minimize the probability that zero-coverage regions are used. (Default: 1000)'

      - --operation
    argument: '{log2,ratio,subtract,add,mean,reciprocal_ratio,first,second}'
    description: 'The default is to output the log2 ratio of the two samples. The reciprocal ratio returns the the negative of the inverse of the ratio if the ratio is less than 0. The resulting values are interpreted as negative fold changes. Instead of performing a computation using both files, the scaled signal can alternatively be output for the first or second file using the ''--operation first'' or ''--operation second''.

    description: 'Region of the genome to limit the operation to - this is useful when testing parameters to reduce the computing time. The format is chr:start:end, for example --region chr10 or --region chr10:456700:891000. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --blackListFileName
      - -bl
    argument: BED file [BED file ...]
    description: 'A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be considered. Please note that you should adjust the effective genome size, if relevant. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --numberOfProcessors
      - -p
    argument: INT
    description: 'Number of processors to use. Type "max/2" to use half the maximum number of processors or "max" to use all available processors. (Default: 1)'

    description: 'Set to see processing messages. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --effectiveGenomeSize
    argument: EFFECTIVEGENOMESIZE
    description: 'The effective genome size is the portion of the genome that is mappable. Large fractions of the genome are stretches of NNNN that should be discarded. Also, if repetitive regions were not included in the mapping of reads, the effective genome size needs to be adjusted accordingly. A table of values is available here: http://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html . (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --normalizeUsing
    argument: '{RPKM,CPM,BPM,RPGC,None}'
    description: 'Use one of the entered methods to normalize the number of reads per bin. By default, no normalization is performed. RPKM = Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads; CPM = Counts Per Million mapped reads, same as CPM in RNA-seq; BPM = Bins Per Million mapped reads, same as TPM in RNA-seq; RPGC = reads per genomic content (1x normalization); Mapped reads are considered after blacklist filtering (if applied). RPKM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / (number of mapped reads (in millions) * bin length (kb)). CPM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / number of mapped reads (in millions). BPM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / sum of all reads per bin (in millions). RPGC (per bin) = number of reads per bin / scaling factor for 1x average coverage. None = the default and equivalent to not setting this option at all. This scaling factor, in turn, is determined from the sequencing depth: (total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the sequencing depth computed for the sample to match the 1x coverage. This option requires --effectiveGenomeSize. Each read is considered independently, if you want to only count one mate from a pair in paired-end data, then use the --samFlagInclude/--samFlagExclude options. (Default: None)'
  - names:
      - --exactScaling
    argument: ""
    description: 'Instead of computing scaling factors based on a sampling of the reads, process all of the reads to determine the exact number that will be used in the output. This requires significantly more time to compute, but will produce more accurate scaling factors in cases where alignments that are being filtered are rare and lumped together. In other words, this is only needed when region-based sampling is expected to produce incorrect results. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --ignoreForNormalization
      - -ignore
    argument: IGNOREFORNORMALIZATION [IGNOREFORNORMALIZATION ...]
    description: 'A list of space-delimited chromosome names containing those chromosomes that should be excluded for computing the normalization. This is useful when considering samples with unequal coverage across chromosomes, like male samples. An usage examples is --ignoreForNormalization chrX chrM. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --skipNonCoveredRegions
      - --skipNAs
    argument: ""
    description: 'This parameter determines if non-covered regions (regions without overlapping reads) in a BAM file should be skipped. The default is to treat those regions as having a value of zero. The decision to skip non-covered regions depends on the interpretation of the data. Non-covered regions may represent, for example, repetitive regions that should be skipped. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --smoothLength
    argument: INT bp
    description: 'The smooth length defines a window, larger than the binSize, to average the number of reads. For example, if the --binSize is set to 20 and the --smoothLength is set to 60, then, for each bin, the average of the bin and its left and right neighbors is considered. Any value smaller than --binSize will be ignored and no smoothing will be applied. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --extendReads
      - -e
    argument: '[INT bp]'
    description: 'This parameter allows the extension of reads to fragment size. If set, each read is extended, without exception. *NOTE*: This feature is generally NOT recommended for spliced-read data, such as RNA-seq, as it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single-end*: Requires a user specified value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that map too far apart (>4x fragment length) or even map to different chromosomes are treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional. If no value is specified, it is estimated from the data (mean of the fragment size of all mate reads). (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --ignoreDuplicates
    argument: ""
    description: 'If set, reads that have the same orientation and start position will be considered only once. If reads are paired, the mate''s position also has to coincide to ignore a read. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --minMappingQuality
    argument: INT
    description: 'If set, only reads that have a mapping quality score of at least this are considered. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --centerReads
    argument: ""
    description: 'By adding this option, reads are centered with respect to the fragment length. For paired-end data, the read is centered at the fragment length defined by the two ends of the fragment. For single-end data, the given fragment length is used. This option is useful to get a sharper signal around enriched regions. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --samFlagInclude
    argument: INT
    description: 'Include reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to get only reads that are the first mate, use a flag of 64. This is useful to count properly paired reads only once, as otherwise the second mate will be also considered for the coverage. (Default: None)'
  - names:
      - --samFlagExclude
    argument: INT
    description: 'Exclude reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to get only reads that map to the forward strand, use --samFlagExclude 16, where 16 is the SAM flag for reads that map to the reverse strand. (Default: None)'
  - names:
      - --minFragmentLength
    argument: INT
    description: 'The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair inclusion. This option is primarily useful in ATACseq experiments, for filtering mono- or di-nucleosome fragments. (Default: 0)'
  - names:
      - --maxFragmentLength
