name: bedops
description: find relationships between two or more genomic datasets
usage: bedops [process-flags] <operation> <File(s)>*
options:
  - names:
      - --chrom
    argument: <chromosome>
    description: Jump to and process data for given <chromosome> only.
  - names:
      - --ec
    argument: ""
    description: Error check input files (slower).
  - names:
      - --header
    argument: ""
    description: Accept headers (VCF, GFF, SAM, BED, WIG) in any input file.
  - names:
      - --help
    argument: ""
    description: Print this message and exit successfully.
  - names:
      - --range
    argument: L:R
    description: Add 'L' bp to all start coordinates and 'R' bp to end coordinates. Either value may be + or - to grow or shrink regions. With the -e/-n operations, the first (reference) file is not padded, unlike all other files.
  - names:
      - --range
    argument: S
    description: 'Pad or shrink input file(s) coordinates symmetrically by S. This is shorthand for: --range -S:S.'
  - names:
      - --version
    argument: ""
    description: Print program information.
  - names:
      - -c
      - --complement
    argument: '[-L] File1 [File]*'
    description: Reports the intervening intervals in between all coordinates found in the input file(s).
  - names:
      - -d
      - --difference
    argument: ReferenceFile File2 [File]*
    description: Reports the intervals found in the first file that are not present in the 2nd (or 3rd or 4th...) files. Requires at least 2 BED file inputs.
  - names:
      - -e
      - --element-of
    argument: ""
    description: ReferenceFile File2 [File]*   Reports the BED rows from file1 that overlap, by the specified percentage or number of base-pair, merged rows from file2, file3, etc. By default, 100% is used as the overlap specification. 'bedops -e 1' is also popular.
  - names:
      - -i
      - --intersect
    argument: File1 File2 [File]*
    description: Reports the intervals common to all input files.
  - names:
      - -m
      - --merge
    argument: File1 [File]*
    description: Merges together (flattens) all disjoint, overlapping, and adjoining intervals from all input files into contiguous, disjoint regions.
  - names:
      - -n
      - --not-element-of
    argument: ""
    description: ReferenceFile File2 [File]*   Reports the BED rows from file1 that do not overlap, by the specified percentage or number of base-pair, merged rows from file2, file3, etc. By default, -100% is used as the overlap specification. 'bedops -n 1' is also popular.
  - names:
      - -p
      - --partition
    argument: File1 [File]*
    description: Breaks up inputs into disjoint (often adjacent) bed intervals.
  - names:
      - -s
      - --symmdiff
    argument: File1 File2 [File]*
    description: Reports the intervals found in exactly 1 input file.
  - names:
      - -u
      - --everything
    argument: File1 [File]*
    description: The output consists of all columns from all rows of all input files.
  - names:
      - -w
      - --chop
    argument: '[bp] [--stagger <nt>] [-x] File1 [File]*'
    description: Produces windowed slices from the merged regions of all input files. By default, -w 1 is used with no staggering.
