usage: bgzip [-cdfhikrt] [-b virtualOffset] [-I index_name] [-l compression_level] [-s size] [-@ threads] [file]
options:
  - names:
      - --binary
    argument: ""
    description: Bgzip will attempt to ensure BGZF blocks end on a newline when the input is a text file. The exception to this is where a single line is larger than a BGZF block (64Kb). This can aid tools that use the index to perform random access on the compressed stream, as the start of a block is likely to also be the start of a text record.
  - names:
      - -b
      - --offset
    argument: INT
    description: Decompress to standard output from virtual file position (0-based uncompressed offset). Implies -c and -d.
  - names:
      - -c
      - --stdout
    argument: ""
    description: Write to standard output, keep original files unchanged.
  - names:
      - -d
      - --decompress
    argument: ""
    description: Decompress.
  - names:
      - -f
      - --force
    argument: ""
    description: Overwrite files without asking, or decompress files that don't have a known compression filename extension (e.g., .gz) without asking. Use --force twice to do both without asking.
  - names:
      - -g
      - --rebgzip
    argument: ""
    description: Try to use an existing index to create a compressed file with matching block offsets. The index must be specified using the -I file.gzi option. Note that this assumes that the same compression library and level are in use as when making the original file. Don't use it unless you know what you're doing.
  - names:
      - -h
      - --help
    argument: ""
    description: Displays a help message.
  - names:
      - -i
      - --index
    argument: ""
    description: Create a BGZF index while compressing. Unless the -I option is used, this will have the name of the compressed file with .gzi appended to it.
  - names:
      - -I
      - --index-name
    argument: FILE
    description: Index file name.
  - names:
      - -k
      - --keep
    argument: ""
    description: Do not delete input file during operation.
  - names:
      - -l
      - --compress-level
    argument: INT
    description: Compression level to use when compressing. From 0 to 9, or -1 for the default level set by the compression library. [-1]
  - names:
      - -r
      - --reindex
    argument: ""
    description: Rebuild the index on an existing compressed file.
  - names:
      - -s
      - --size
    argument: INT
    description: Decompress INT bytes (uncompressed size) to standard output. Implies -c.
  - names:
      - -t
      - --test
    argument: ""
    description: Test the intregrity of the compressed file.
  - names:
      - -@
      - --threads
    argument: INT
