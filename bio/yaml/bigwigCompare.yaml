options:
  - names:
      - -h
      - --help
    argument: ""
    description: show this help message and exit
  - names:
      - --bigwig1
      - -b1
    argument: Bigwig file
    description: 'Bigwig file 1. Usually the file for the treatment. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --bigwig2
      - -b2
    argument: Bigwig file
    description: 'Bigwig file 2. Usually the file for the control. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --scaleFactors
    argument: SCALEFACTORS
    description: 'Set this parameter to multipy the bigwig values by a constant. The format is scaleFactor1:scaleFactor2. For example 0.7:1 to scale the first bigwig file by 0.7 while not scaling the second bigwig file (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --pseudocount
    argument: PSEUDOCOUNT [PSEUDOCOUNT ...]
    description: 'A small number to avoid x/0. Only useful together with --operation log2 or --operation ratio. You can specify different values as pseudocounts for the numerator and the denominator by providing two values (the first value is used as the numerator pseudocount and the second the denominator pseudocount). (Default: 1)'
  - names:
      - --skipZeroOverZero
    argument: ""
    description: 'Skip bins where BOTH BAM files lack coverage. This is determined BEFORE any applicable pseudocount is added. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --operation
    argument: '{log2,ratio,subtract,add,mean,reciprocal_ratio,first,second}'
    description: 'The default is to output the log2ratio of the two samples. The reciprocal ratio returns the the negative of the inverse of the ratio if the ratio is less than 0. The resulting values are interpreted as negative fold changes. Instead of performing a computation using both files, the scaled signal can alternatively be output for the first or second file using the ''--operation first'' or ''--operation second'' (Default: log2)'
  - names:
      - --skipNonCoveredRegions
      - --skipNAs
    argument: ""
    description: 'This parameter determines if non-covered regions (regions without a score) in the bigWig files should be skipped. The default is to treat those regions as having a value of zero. The decision to skip non-covered regions depends on the interpretation of the data. Non-covered regions in a bigWig file may represent repetitive regions that should be skipped. Alternatively, the interpretation of non-covered regions as zeros may be wrong and this option should be used (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --version
    argument: ""
    description: show program's version number and exit
  - names:
      - --binSize
      - -bs
    argument: INT bp
    description: 'Size of the bins, in bases, for the output of the bigwig/bedgraph file. (Default: 50)'
  - names:
      - --region
      - -r
    argument: CHR:START:END
    description: 'Region of the genome to limit the operation to - this is useful when testing parameters to reduce the computing time. The format is chr:start:end, for example --region chr10 or --region chr10:456700:891000. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --blackListFileName
      - -bl
    argument: BED file [BED file ...]
    description: 'A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be considered. Please note that you should adjust the effective genome size, if relevant. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --numberOfProcessors
      - -p
    argument: INT
    description: 'Number of processors to use. Type "max/2" to use half the maximum number of processors or "max" to use all available processors. (Default: 1)'
  - names:
      - --verbose
      - -v
    argument: ""
    description: 'Set to see processing messages. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --outFileName
      - -o
    argument: FILENAME
    description: 'Output file name. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --outFileFormat
      - -of
    argument: '{bigwig,bedgraph}'
    description: 'Output file type. Either "bigwig" or "bedgraph". (default: bigwig)'
  - names:
      - --deepBlueURL
    argument: DEEPBLUEURL
    description: 'For remote files bedgraph/wiggle files hosted on deepBlue, this specifies the server URL. The default is "http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xmlrpc", which should not be changed without good reason. (default: http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xmlrpc)'
  - names:
      - --userKey
    argument: USERKEY
    description: 'For remote files bedgraph/wiggle files hosted on deepBlue, this specifies the user key to use for access. The default is "anonymous_key", which suffices for public datasets. If you need access to a restricted access/private dataset, then request a key from deepBlue and specify it here. (default: anonymous_key)'
  - names:
      - --deepBlueTempDir
    argument: DEEPBLUETEMPDIR
    description: 'If specified, temporary files from preloading datasets from deepBlue will be written here (note, this directory must exist). If not specified, where ever temporary files would normally be written on your system is used. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --deepBlueKeepTemp
    argument: ""
    description: 'If specified, temporary bigWig files from preloading deepBlue datasets are not deleted. A message will be printed noting where these files are and what sample they correspond to. These can then be used if you wish to analyse the same sample with the same regions again. (default: False)'
