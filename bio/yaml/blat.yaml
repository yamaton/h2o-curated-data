usage: blat database query [-ooc=11.ooc] output.psl
positionalArguments:
  - name: database
    description: Either .fa, .nib or .2bit file
  - name: query
    description: Either .fa, .nib or .2bit file
  - name: output.psl
    description: name of the output file.
options:
  - names:
      - -t
    argument: '{dna,prot,dnax}'
    description: Database type. The default is dna.
  - names:
      - -q
    argument: '{dna,rna,prot,dnax,rnax}'
    description: Query type. The default is dna.
  - names:
      - -prot
    argument: ""
    description: Synonymous with -t=prot -q=prot.
  - names:
      - -ooc
    argument: N.ooc
    description: Use overused tile file N.ooc. N should correspond to the tileSize.
  - names:
      - -tileSize
    argument: "N"
    description: Sets the size of match that triggers an alignment. Usually between 8 and 12. Default is 11 for DNA and 5 for protein.
  - names:
      - -stepSize
    argument: "N"
    description: Spacing between tiles. Default is tileSize.
  - names:
      - -oneOff
    argument: "N"
    description: If set to 1, this allows one mismatch in tile and still triggers an alignment. Default is 0.
  - names:
      - -minMatch
    argument: "N"
    description: Sets the number of tile matches. Usually set from 2 to 4. Default is 2 for nucleotide, 1 for protein.
  - names:
      - -minScore
    argument: "N"
    description: Sets minimum score. This is the matches minus the mismatches minus some sort of gap penalty. Default is 30.
  - names:
      - -minIdentity
    argument: "N"
    description: Sets minimum sequence identity (in percent). Default is 90 for nucleotide searches, 25 for protein or translated protein searches.
  - names:
      - -maxGap
    argument: "N"
    description: Sets the size of maximum gap between tiles in a clump. Usually set from 0 to 3. Default is 2. Only relevent for minMatch > 1.
  - names:
      - -noHead
    argument: ""
    description: Suppresses .psl header (so it's just a tab-separated file).
  - names:
      - -makeOoc
    argument: N.ooc
    description: Make overused tile file. Target needs to be complete genome.
  - names:
      - -repMatch
    argument: "N"
    description: 'Sets the number of repetitions of a tile allowed before it is marked as overused. Typically this is 256 for tileSize 12, 1024 for tile size 11, 4096 for tile size 10. Default is 1024. Typically comes into play only with makeOoc. Also affected by stepSize: when stepSize is halved, repMatch is doubled to compensate.'
  - names:
      - -mask
    argument: '{lower,uppser,out,file.out}'
    description: Mask out repeats. Alignments won't be started in masked region but may extend through it in nucleotide searches. Masked areas are ignored entirely in protein or translated searches.
  - names:
      - -qMask
    argument: type
    description: Mask out repeats in query sequence. Similar to -mask above, but for query rather than target sequence.
  - names:
      - -repeats
    argument: type
    description: Type is same as mask types above. Repeat bases will not be masked in any way, but matches in repeat areas will be reported separately from matches in other areas in the psl output.
  - names:
      - -minRepDivergence
    argument: NN
    description: Minimum percent divergence of repeats to allow them to be unmasked. Default is 15. Only relevant for masking using RepeatMasker .out files.
  - names:
      - -dots
    argument: "N"
    description: Output dot every N sequences to show program's progress.
  - names:
      - -trimT
    argument: ""
    description: Trim leading poly-T.
  - names:
      - -noTrimA
    argument: ""
    description: Don't trim trailing poly-A.
  - names:
      - -trimHardA
    argument: ""
    description: Remove poly-A tail from qSize as well as alignments in psl output.
  - names:
      - -fastMap
    argument: ""
    description: Run for fast DNA/DNA remapping - not allowing introns, requiring high %ID. Query sizes must not exceed 5000.
  - names:
      - -out
    argument: '{psl,pslx,axt,maf,sim4,wublast,blast,blast8,blast9}'
    description: Controls output file format.
  - names:
      - -fine
    argument: ""
    description: For high-quality mRNAs, look harder for small initial and terminal exons. Not recommended for ESTs.
  - names:
      - -maxIntron
    argument: "N"
    description: Sets maximum intron size. Default is 750000.
  - names:
      - -extendThroughN
    argument: ""
    description: Allows extension of alignment through large blocks of Ns.
