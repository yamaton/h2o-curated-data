options:
  - names:
      - --bamfile
      - -b
    argument: bam file
    description: 'Sorted BAM file. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --effectiveGenomeSize
    argument: EFFECTIVEGENOMESIZE
    description: 'The effective genome size is the portion of the genome that is mappable. Large fractions of the genome are stretches of NNNN that should be discarded. Also, if repetitive regions were not included in the mapping of reads, the effective genome size needs to be adjusted accordingly. A table of values is available here: http://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html . (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --genome
      - -g
    argument: 2bit FILE
    description: 'Genome in two bit format. Most genomes can be found here: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/gbdb/ Search for the .2bit ending. Otherwise, fasta files can be converted to 2bit using the UCSC programm called faToTwoBit available for different plattforms at http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/ (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --GCbiasFrequenciesFile
      - -freq
      - -o
    argument: FILE
    description: 'Path to save the file containing the observed and expected read frequencies per %GC-content. This file is needed to run the correctGCBias tool. This is a text file. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --fragmentLength
      - -l
    argument: FRAGMENTLENGTH
    description: 'Fragment length used for the sequencing. If paired-end reads are used, the fragment length is computed based from the bam file (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --help
      - -h
    argument: ""
    description: show this help message and exit
  - names:
      - --sampleSize
    argument: SAMPLESIZE
    description: 'Number of sampling points to be considered. (Default: 50000000.0)'
  - names:
      - --extraSampling
    argument: BED file
    description: 'BED file containing genomic regions for which extra sampling is required because they are underrepresented in the genome. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --version
    argument: ""
    description: show program's version number and exit
  - names:
      - --region
      - -r
    argument: CHR:START:END
    description: 'Region of the genome to limit the operation to - this is useful when testing parameters to reduce the computing time. The format is chr:start:end, for example --region chr10 or --region chr10:456700:891000. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --blackListFileName
      - -bl
    argument: BED file [BED file ...]
    description: 'A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be considered. Please note that you should adjust the effective genome size, if relevant. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --numberOfProcessors
      - -p
    argument: INT
    description: 'Number of processors to use. Type "max/2" to use half the maximum number of processors or "max" to use all available processors. (Default: 1)'

      - --verbose
      - -v

    description: 'Set to see processing messages. (default: False)'
  - names:
      - --biasPlot
    argument: FILE NAME
    description: 'If given, a diagnostic image summarizing the GC-bias will be saved. (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --plotFileFormat
    argument: ""
    description: 'image format type. If given, this option overrides the image format based on the plotFile ending. The available options are: "png", "eps", "pdf", "plotly" and "svg" (default: None)'
  - names:
      - --regionSize
    argument: INT
    description: 'To plot the reads per %GC over a regionthe size of the region is required. By default, the bin size is set to 300 bases, which is close to the standard fragment size for Illumina machines. However, if the depth of sequencing is low, a larger bin size will be required, otherwise many bins will not overlap with any read (Default: 300)'
