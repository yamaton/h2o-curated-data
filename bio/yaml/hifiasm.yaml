options:
  - names:
      - -o
    argument: FILE
    description: Prefix of output files [hifiasm.asm]. For detailed description of all assembly graphs, please see the OUTPUTS section of this man-page.
  - names:
      - -t
    argument: INT
    description: Number of CPU threads used by hifiasm [1].
  - names:
      - -h
    argument: ""
    description: Show help information.
  - names:
      - --version
    argument: ""
    description: Show version number.
  - names:
      - -k
    argument: INT
    description: K-mer length [51]. This option must be less than 64.
  - names:
      - -w
    argument: INT
    description: Minimizer window size [51].
  - names:
      - -f
    argument: INT
    description: Number of bits for bloom filter; 0 to disable [37]. This bloom filter is used to filter out singleton k-mers when counting all kmers. It takes 2^(INT-3) bytes of memory. A proper setting saves memory. -f37 is recommended for human assembly. For small genomes, use -f0 to disable the initial bloom filter which takes 16GB memory at the beginning. For genomes much larger than human, applying -f38 or even -f39 is preferred to save memory on k-mer counting.
  - names:
      - -D
    argument: INT
    description: Drop k-mers occurring >FLOAT*coverage times [5.0]. Hifiasm discards these high-frequency k-mers during error correction to reduce running time. The coverage is determined automatically by hifiasm based on k-mer plot, representing homozygous read coverage. Raising this option may improve the resolution of repetitive regions but takes longer time.
  - names:
      - -N
    argument: INT
    description: Consider up to max(-D*coverage,-N) overlaps for each oriented read [100]. The coverage is determined automatically by hifiasm based on k-mer plot, representing homozygous read coverage. Raising this option may improve the resolution of repetitive regions but takes longer time.
  - names:
      - -r
    argument: INT
    description: Rounds of haplotype-aware error corrections [3]. This option affects all outputs of hifiasm. Odd rounds of correction are preferred in practice.
  - names:
      - -z
    argument: INT
    description: Length of adapters that should be removed [0]. This option remove INT bases from both ends of each read. Some old Hifi reads may consist of short adapters (e.g., 20bp adapter at one end). For such data, trimming short adapters would significantly improve the assembly quality.
  - names:
      - --max-kocc
    argument: INT
    description: Employ k-mers occurring < INT times to rescue repetitive overlaps [2000]. This option may improve the resolution of repeats.
  - names:
      - --hg-size
    argument: INT(k/m/g)
    description: Estimated haploid genome size used for inferring read coverage [auto]. This option is used to get accurate homozygous read coverage during error correction. Common suffices are required, for example, 100m or 3g.
  - names:
      - --min-hist-cnt
    argument: INT
    description: When analyzing the k-mer spectrum, ignore counts below INT [5]. For very low coverage of HiFi data, set smaller value for this option.
  - names:
      - -a
    argument: INT
    description: Rounds of assembly graph cleaning [4]. This option is used with -x and -y. Note that unlike -r, this option does not affect error corrected reads and all-to-all overlaps.
  - names:
      - -m
    argument: INT
    description: Maximal probing distance for bubble popping when generating primary/alternate contig graphs [10000000]. Bubbles longer than INT bases will not be popped. For detailed description of these graphs, please see the OUTPUTS section of this man-page.
  - names:
      - -p
    argument: INT
    description: Maximal probing distance for bubble popping when generating haplotype-resolved processed unitig graph without small bubbles [0]. Bubbles longer than INT bases will not be popped. Small bubbles might be caused by somatic mutations or noise in data. Please note that hifiasm automatically pops small bubbles based on coverage, which can be tweaked by --hom-cov. For detailed description of this graph, please see the OUTPUTS section of this man-page.
  - names:
      - -n
    argument: INT
    description: A unitig is considered small if it is composed of less than INT reads [3]. Hifiasm may try to remove small unitigs at various steps.
  - names:
      - -x
      - -y
    argument: FLOAT1
    description: Max and min overlap drop ratio [0.8, 0.2]. This option is used with -a. Given a node N in the assembly graph, let max(N) be the length of the longest overlap of N. Hifiasm iteratively drops overlaps of N if their length / max(N) are below a threshold controlled by -x and -y. Hifiasm applies -a rounds of short overlap removal with an increasing threshold between FLOAT1 and FLOAT2.
  - names:
      - -i
    argument: ""
    description: Ignore error corrected reads and overlaps saved in prefix.*.bin files so that hifiasm will start again from scratch. Apart from assembly graphs, hifiasm also outputs three binary files that save all overlap information during assembly step. With these files, hifiasm can avoid the time-consuming all-to-all overlap calculation step, and do the assembly directly and quickly. This might be helpful when users want to get an optimized assembly by multiple rounds of experiments with different parameters.
  - names:
      - -u
    argument: ""
    description: Disable post-join step for contigs which may improve N50. The post-join step of hifiasm improves contig N50 but may introduce misassemblies.
