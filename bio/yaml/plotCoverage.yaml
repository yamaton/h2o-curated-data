    argument: sample1 sample2 [sample1 sample2 ...]

  - names:
      - --plotTitle
      - -T
    argument: PLOTTITLE
    description: 'Title of the plot, to be printed on top of the generated image. Leave blank for no title. (Default: )'

    argument: NUMBEROFSAMPLES
    description: 'Number of 1 bp regions to sample. (Default: 1000000)'
  - names:
      - --BED
    argument: FILE1.bed FILE2.bed [FILE1.bed FILE2.bed ...]
    description: Limits the coverage analysis to the regions specified in these files. This overrides --numberOfSamples. Due to memory requirements, it is inadvised to combine this with --outRawCounts or many tens of thousands of regions, as per-base coverage is used!
  - names:
      - --outRawCounts
    argument: FILE
    description: Save raw counts (coverages) to file.
  - names:
      - --outCoverageMetrics
    argument: FILE
    description: Save percentage of bins/regions above the specified thresholds to the specified file. The coverage thresholds are specified by --coverageThresholds. If no coverage thresholds are specified, the file will be empty.
  - names:
      - --coverageThresholds
      - -ct
    argument: COVERAGETHRESHOLDS
    description: The percentage of reported bins/regions with signal at least as high as the given threshold. This can be specified multiple times.
  - names:
      - --plotHeight
    argument: PLOTHEIGHT
    description: 'Plot height in cm. (Default: 5.0)'
  - names:
      - --plotWidth
    argument: PLOTWIDTH
    description: 'Plot width in cm. The minimum value is 1 cm. (Default: 15.0)'
  - names:
      - --plotFileFormat
    argument: FILETYPE
    description: 'Image format type. If given, this option overrides the image format based on the plotFile ending. The available options are: png, eps, pdf, svg and plotly.'
  - names:
      - --region
      - -r
    argument: CHR:START:END
    description: Region of the genome to limit the operation to - this is useful when testing parameters to reduce the computing time. The format is chr:start:end, for example --region chr10 or --region chr10:456700:891000.
  - names:
      - --blackListFileName
      - -bl
    argument: BED file [BED file ...]
    description: A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be considered. Please note that you should adjust the effective genome size, if relevant.
  - names:
      - --numberOfProcessors
      - -p
    argument: INT
    description: 'Number of processors to use. Type "max/2" to use half the maximum number of processors or "max" to use all available processors. (Default: 1)'
  - names:
      - --verbose
      - -v
    argument: ""
    description: Set to see processing messages.
  - names:
      - --extendReads
      - -e
    argument: '[INT bp]'
    description: 'This parameter allows the extension of reads to fragment size. If set, each read is extended, without exception. *NOTE*: This feature is generally NOT recommended for spliced-read data, such as RNA-seq, as it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single-end*: Requires a user specified value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that map too far apart (>4x fragment length) or even map to different chromosomes are treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional. If no value is specified, it is estimated from the data (mean of the fragment size of all mate reads).'
  - names:
      - --ignoreDuplicates
    argument: ""
    description: If set, reads that have the same orientation and start position will be considered only once. If reads are paired, the mate's position also has to coincide to ignore a read.
  - names:
      - --minMappingQuality
    argument: INT
    description: If set, only reads that have a mapping quality score of at least this are considered.
  - names:
      - --centerReads
    argument: ""
    description: By adding this option, reads are centered with respect to the fragment length. For paired-end data, the read is centered at the fragment length defined by the two ends of the fragment. For single-end data, the given fragment length is used. This option is useful to get a sharper signal around enriched regions.
  - names:
      - --samFlagInclude
    argument: INT
    description: 'Include reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to get only reads that are the first mate, use a flag of 64. This is useful to count properly paired reads only once, as otherwise the second mate will be also considered for the coverage. (Default: None)'
  - names:
      - --samFlagExclude
    argument: INT
    description: 'Exclude reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to get only reads that map to the forward strand, use --samFlagExclude 16, where 16 is the SAM flag for reads that map to the reverse strand. (Default: None)'
  - names:
      - --minFragmentLength
    argument: INT
    description: 'The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair inclusion. This option is primarily useful in ATACseq experiments, for filtering mono- or di-nucleosome fragments. (Default: 0)'
  - names:
      - --maxFragmentLength
    argument: INT
    description: 'The maximum fragment length needed for read/pair inclusion. (Default: 0)'
