    description: Maintain site and allele-level annotations when decomposing. Note that in many cases, such as multisample VCFs, these won't be valid post-decomposition. For biallelic loci in single-sample VCFs, they should be usable with caution.

    description: Maintain genotype-level annotations when decomposing. Similar caution should be used for this as for --keep-info.
