options:
  - names:
      - --vcf
    argument: <input_filename>
    description: This option defines the VCF file to be processed. VCFtools expects files in VCF format v4.0, v4.1 or v4.2. The latter two are supported with some small limitations. If the user provides a dash character '-' as a file name, the program expects a VCF file to be piped in through standard in.
  - names:
      - --gzvcf
    argument: <input_filename>
    description: This option can be used in place of the --vcf option to read compressed (gzipped) VCF files directly.
  - names:

    argument: <input_filename>
    description: This option can be used in place of the --vcf option to read BCF2 files directly. You do not need to specify if this file is compressed with BGZF encoding. If the user provides a dash character '-' as a file name, the program expects a BCF2 file to be piped in through standard in.
  - names:

For LDhelmet, only snps will be considered, and therefore it implies "--remove-indels". The second option treats all of the data as unphased, and therefore outputs LDhat files in genotype/unphased format. Two output files are generated with the suffixes ".ldhat.sites" and ".ldhat.locs", which correspond to the LDhat "sites" and "locs" input files respectively; for LDhelmet, the two files generated have the suffixes ".ldhelmet.snps" and ".ldhelmet.pos", which corresponds to the "SNPs" and "positions" files.

    argument: ""
    description: 'These options output the genotype data in PLINK PED format. With the first option, two files are generated, with suffixes ".ped" and ".map". Note that only bi-allelic loci will be output. Further details of these files can be found in the PLINK documentation. Note: The first option can be very slow on large datasets. Using the --chr option to divide up the dataset is advised, or alternatively use the --plink-tped option which outputs the files in the PLINK transposed format with suffixes ".tped" and ".tfam". For usage with variant sites in species other than humans, the --chrom-map option may be used to specify a file name that has a tab-delimited mapping of chromosome name to a desired integer value with one line per chromosome. This file must contain a mapping for every chromosome value found in the file.'
  - names:
      - --diff
      - --gzdiff
      - --diff-bcf
    argument: <filename>
    description: These options compare the original input file to this specified VCF, gzipped VCF, or BCF file. These options must be specified with one additional option described below in order to specify what type of comparison is to be performed. See the examples section for typical usage.
  - names:
      - --diff-site
    argument: ""
    description: Outputs the sites that are common / unique to each file. The output file has the suffix ".diff.sites_in_files".
  - names:
      - --diff-indv
    argument: ""
    description: Outputs the individuals that are common / unique to each file. The output file has the suffix ".diff.indv_in_files".
  - names:
      - --diff-site-discordance
    argument: ""
    description: This option calculates discordance on a site by site basis. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.sites".
  - names:
      - --diff-indv-discordance
    argument: ""
    description: This option calculates discordance on a per-individual basis. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.indv".
  - names:
      - --diff-indv-map
    argument: <filename>
    description: This option allows the user to specify a mapping of individual IDs in the second file to those in the first file. The program expects the file to contain a tab-delimited line containing an individual's name in file one followed by that same individual's name in file two with one mapping per line.
  - names:
      - --diff-discordance-matrix
    argument: ""
    description: This option calculates a discordance matrix. This option only works with bi-allelic loci with matching alleles that are present in both files. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.discordance.matrix".
  - names:
      - --diff-switch-error
    argument: ""
    description: This option calculates phasing errors (specifically "switch errors"). This option creates an output file describing switch errors found between sites, with suffix ".diff.switch".
