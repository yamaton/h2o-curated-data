If this option is not set then the output file for each sequence file is created in the same directory as the sequence file which was processed.]' \
        '--casava[Files come from raw casava output. Files in the same sample group (differing only by the group number) will be analysed as a set rather than individually. Sequences with the filter flag set in the header will be excluded from the analysis. Files must have the same names given to them by casava (including being gzipped and ending with .gz) otherwise they won'\''t be grouped together correctly.]' \
        '--nano[Files come from nanopore sequences and are in fast5 format. In this mode you can pass in directories to process and the program will take in all fast5 files within those directories and produce a single output file from the sequences found in all files.                    ]' \
        '--nofilter[If running with --casava then don'\''t remove read flagged by casava as poor quality when performing the QC analysis.]' \

        '--min_length[Sets an artificial lower limit on the length of the sequence to be shown in the report.  As long as you set this to a value greater or equal to your longest read length then this will be the sequence length used to create your read groups.  This can be useful for making directly comaparable statistics from datasets with somewhat variable read lengths.]' \
