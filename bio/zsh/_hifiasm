        '-o[Prefix of output files \[hifiasm.asm\]. For detailed description of all assembly graphs, please see the OUTPUTS section of this man-page.]' \
        '-t[Number of CPU threads used by hifiasm \[1\].]' \
        '-h[Show help information.]' \
        '--version[Show version number.]' \
        '-k[K-mer length \[51\]. This option must be less than 64.]' \
        '-w[Minimizer window size \[51\].]' \
        '-f[Number of bits for bloom filter; 0 to disable \[37\]. This bloom filter is used to filter out singleton k-mers when counting all k-mers. It takes 2^(INT-3) bytes of memory. A proper setting saves memory. 37 is recommended for human assembly.]' \
        '-r[Rounds of haplotype-aware error corrections \[3\]. This option affects all outputs of hifiasm.]' \
        '--min-hist-cnt[When analyzing the k-mer spectrum, ignore counts below INT.]' \
        '-a[Rounds of assembly graph cleaning \[4\]. This option is used with -x and -y. Note that unlike -r, this option does not affect error corrected reads and all-to-all overlaps.]' \
        '-z[Length of adapters that should be removed \[0\]. This option remove INT bases from both ends of each read. Some old Hifi reads may consist of short adapters (e.g., 20bp adapter at one end). For such data, trimming short adapters would significantly improve the assembly quality.]' \
        '-m[Maximal probing distance for bubble popping when generating primary/alternate contig graphs \[10000000\]. Bubbles longer than INT bases will not be popped. For detailed description of these graphs, please see the OUTPUTS section of this man-page.]' \
        '-p[Maximal probing distance for bubble popping when generating haplotype-resolved processed unitig graph without small bubbles \[100000\]. Bubbles longer than INT bases will not be popped. Small bubbles might be caused by somatic mutations or noise in data, which are not the real haplotype information. For detailed description of this graph, please see the OUTPUTS section of this man-page.]' \
        '-n[A unitig is considered small if it is composed of less than INT reads \[3\]. Hifiasm may try to remove small unitigs at various steps.]' \
        '(-x -y)'{-x,-y}'[Max and min overlap drop ratio \[0.8, 0.2\]. This option is used with -r. Given a node N in the assembly graph, let max(N) be the length of the largest overlap of N. Hifiasm iteratively drops overlaps of N if their length / max(N) are below a threshold controlled by -x and -y. Hifiasm applies -r rounds of short overlap removal with an increasing threshold between -x and -y.]' \
        '-i[Ignore error corrected reads and overlaps saved in prefix.*.bin files. Apart from assembly graphs, hifiasm also outputs three binary files that save all overlap information during assembly step. With these files, hifiasm can avoid the time-consuming all-to-all overlap calculation step, and do the assembly directly and quickly. This might be helpful when users want to get an optimized assembly by multiple rounds of experiments with different parameters.]' \
        '--pri-range[Min and max coverage cutoff of primary contigs. Keep contigs with coverage in this range at p_ctg.gfa. Inferred automatically in default. If INT2 is not specified, it is set to infinity. Set -1 to disable.]' \

        '--primary[Output a primary assembly and an alternate assembly. Hifiasm outputs two balanced assemblies and a primary assembly in default. Enable this option or -l0 outputs a primary assembly and an alternate assembly.]' \

In default, \[3\] for nontrio assembly, \[0\] for trio assembly. For trio assembly, only level 0 and level 1 are allowed.]' \
