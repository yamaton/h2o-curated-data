Example: "scaffold00001,scaffold00002:10000-20000" would result in processing all of scaffold00001 and coordinates 10000-20000 of scaffold00002. If "targetlist" is the name of a file, each line will be treated as a target specification.]' \

Identifying stray pairs can help fill gaps and assemble larger insertions, especially of repeat content. However, doing so sometimes consumes considerable memory.]' \
