The provided file must contain a list of individuals (one individual per line) from the VCF file that correspond to one population.

The output file has the suffix ".singletons".]' \
        '--hist-indel-len[This option will generate a histogram file of the length of all indels (including SNPs).

The output file has the suffix ".recode.vcf" or ".recode.bcf". By default, the INFO fields are removed from the output file, as the INFO values may be invalidated by the recoding (e.g. the total depth may need to be recalculated if individuals are removed). This behavior may be overriden by the following options. By default, BCF files are written out as BGZF compressed files.]' \
        '(--recode-INFO --recode-INFO-all)'{--recode-INFO,--recode-INFO-all}'[These options can be used with the above recode options to define an INFO key name to keep in the output file.

Genotypes are represented as 0, 1 and 2, where the number represent that number of non-reference alleles. Missing genotypes are represented by -1.

        '--IMPUTE[This option outputs phased haplotypes in IMPUTE reference-panel format. As IMPUTE requires phased data, using this option also implies --phased. Unphased individuals and genotypes are therefore excluded. Only bi-allelic sites are included in the output. Using this option generates three files. The IMPUTE haplotype file has the suffix ".impute.hap", and the IMPUTE legend file has the suffix ".impute.hap.legend". The third file, with suffix ".impute.hap.indv", details the individuals included in the haplotype file, although this file is not needed by IMPUTE.]' \
        '(--ldhat --ldhelmet --ldhat-geno)'{--ldhat,--ldhelmet,--ldhat-geno}'[These options output data in LDhat/LDhelmet format. This option requires the "--chr" filter option to also be used. The two first options output phased data only, and therefore also implies "--phased" be used, leading to unphased individuals and genotypes being excluded. For LDhelmet, only snps will be considered, and therefore it implies "--remove-indels". The second option treats all of the data as unphased, and therefore outputs LDhat files in genotype/unphased format. Two output files are generated with the suffixes ".ldhat.sites" and ".ldhat.locs", which correspond to the LDhat "sites" and "locs" input files respectively; for LDhelmet, the two files generated have the suffixes ".ldhelmet.snps" and ".ldhelmet.pos", which corresponds to the "SNPs" and "positions" files.]' \
        '(--BEAGLE-GL --BEAGLE-PL)'{--BEAGLE-GL,--BEAGLE-PL}'[These options output genotype likelihood information for input into the BEAGLE program. The VCF file is required to contain FORMAT fields with "GL" or "PL" tags, which can generally be output by SNP callers such as the GATK. Use of this option requires a chromosome to be specified via the "--chr" option. The resulting output file has the suffix ".BEAGLE.GL" or ".BEAGLE.PL" and contains genotype likelihoods for biallelic sites. This file is suitable for input into BEAGLE via the "like=" argument.]' \
        '(--plink --plink-tped --chrom-map)'{--plink,--plink-tped,--chrom-map}'[These options output the genotype data in PLINK PED format. With the first option, two files are generated, with suffixes ".ped" and ".map". Note that only bi-allelic loci will be output. Further details of these files can be found in the PLINK documentation. Note: The first option can be very slow on large datasets. Using the --chr option to divide up the dataset is advised, or alternatively use the --plink-tped option which outputs the files in the PLINK transposed format with suffixes ".tped" and ".tfam". For usage with variant sites in species other than humans, the --chrom-map option may be used to specify a file name that has a tab-delimited mapping of chromosome name to a desired integer value with one line per chromosome. This file must contain a mapping for every chromosome value found in the file.]' \
        '(--diff --gzdiff --diff-bcf)'{--diff,--gzdiff,--diff-bcf}'[These options compare the original input file to this specified VCF, gzipped VCF, or BCF file.

        '--diff-indv-map[This option allows the user to specify a mapping of individual IDs in the second file to those in the first file. The program expects the file to contain a tab-delimited line containing an individual'\''s name in file one followed by that same individual'\''s name in file two with one mapping per line.]:file:_files' \
        '--diff-discordance-matrix[This option calculates a discordance matrix. This option only works with bi-allelic loci with matching alleles that are present in both files. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.discordance.matrix".]' \
