If -f has also been specified, its argument is used as a prefix to the default path for the resulting host key files. This is used by system administration scripts to generate new host keys."},{"names":["-a"],"argument":"rounds","description":"When saving a private key, this option specifies the number of KDF (key derivation function) rounds used. Higher numbers result in slower passphrase verification and increased resistance to brute-force password cracking (should the keys be stolen)."},{"names":["-B"],"argument":"","description":"Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key file."},{"names":["-b"],"argument":"bits","description":"Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 3072 bits. Generally, 3072 bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, the -b flag determines the key length by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521 bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for ECDSA keys will fail. ECDSA-SK, Ed25519 and Ed25519-SK keys have a fixed length and the -b flag will be ignored."},{"names":["-C"],"argument":"comment","description":"Provides a new comment."},{"names":["-c"],"argument":"","description":"Requests changing the comment in the private and public key files.

These hashes may be used normally by ssh and sshd, but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed. This option will not modify existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed names."},{"names":["-h"],"argument":"","description":"When signing a key, create a host certificate instead of a user certificate.

The latter may be used to convert between OpenSSH private key and PEM private key formats. The supported key formats are: “RFC4716” (RFC 4716/SSH2 public or private key), “PKCS8” (PKCS8 public or private key) or “PEM” (PEM public key). By default OpenSSH will write newly-generated private keys in its own format, but when converting public keys for export the default format is “RFC4716”. Setting a format of “PEM” when generating or updating a supported private key type will cause the key to be stored in the legacy PEM private key format."},{"names":["-N"],"argument":"new_passphrase","description":"Provides the new passphrase."},{"names":["-n"],"argument":"principals","description":"Specify one or more principals (user or host names) to be included in a certificate when signing a key.

A validity interval may consist of a single time, indicating that the certificate is valid beginning now and expiring at that time, or may consist of two times separated by a colon to indicate an explicit time interval."},{"names":["-v"],"argument":"","description":"Verbose mode.
