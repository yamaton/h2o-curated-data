  - Update the list of available packages and versions (it's recommended to run this before other `apt` commands):

  `sudo apt update`

  - Search for a given package:

  `apt search {{package}}`

  - Show information for a package:

  `apt show {{package}}`

  - Install a package, or update it to the latest available version:

  `sudo apt install {{package}}`

  - Remove a package (using `purge` instead also removes its configuration files):

  `sudo apt remove {{package}}`

  - Upgrade all installed packages to their newest available versions:

  `sudo apt upgrade`

  - List all packages:

  `apt list`

  - List installed packages:

  `apt list --installed`
