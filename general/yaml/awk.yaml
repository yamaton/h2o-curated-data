usage: |-
  gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file ...
  gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ -- ] program-text file ...
options:
  - names:
      - -f
      - --file
    argument: program-file
    description: Read the AWK program source from the file program-file, instead of from the first command line argument. Multiple -f (or --file) options may be used. Files read with -f are treated as if they begin with an implicit @namespace "awk" statement.
  - names:
      - -F
      - --field-separator
    argument: fs
    description: Use fs for the input field separator (the value of the FS predefined variable).
  - names:
      - -v
      - --assign
    argument: var=val
    description: Assign the value val to the variable var, before execution of the program begins. Such variable values are available to the BEGIN rule of an AWK program.
  - names:
      - -b
      - --characters-as-bytes
    argument: ""
    description: Treat all input data as single-byte characters. In other words, don't pay any attention to the locale information when attempting to process strings as multibyte characters. The --posix option overrides this one.
  - names:
      - -c
      - --traditional
    argument: ""
    description: Run in compatibility mode. In compatibility mode, gawk behaves identically to Brian Kernighan's awk; none of the GNU-specific extensions are recognized. See GNU EXTENSIONS, below, for more information.
  - names:
      - -C
      - --copyright
    argument: ""
    description: Print the short version of the GNU copyright information message on the standard output and exit successfully.
  - names:
      - -d
      - --dump-variables
    argument: '[file]'
    description: Print a sorted list of global variables, their types and final values to file. If no file is provided, gawk uses a file named awkvars.out in the current directory. Having a list of all the global variables is a good way to look for typographical errors in your programs. You would also use this option if you have a large program with a lot of functions, and you want to be sure that your functions don't inadvertently use global variables that you meant to be local. (This is a particularly easy mistake to make with simple variable names like i, j, and so on.)
  - names:
      - -D
      - --debug
    argument: '[file]'
    description: Enable debugging of AWK programs. By default, the debugger reads commands interactively from the keyboard (standard input). The optional file argument specifies a file with a list of commands for the debugger to execute non-interactively.
  - names:
      - -e
      - --source
    argument: program-text
    description: Use program-text as AWK program source code. This option allows the easy intermixing of library functions (used via the -f and --include options) with source code entered on the command line. It is intended primarily for medium to large AWK programs used in shell scripts. Each argument supplied via -e is treated as if it begins with an implicit @namespace "awk" statement.
  - names:
      - -E
      - --exec
    argument: file
    description: 'Similar to -f, however, this is option is the last one processed. This should be used with #! scripts, particularly for CGI applications, to avoid passing in options or source code (!) on the command line from a URL. This option disables command-line variable assignments.'
  - names:
      - -g
      - --gen-pot
    argument: ""
    description: Scan and parse the AWK program, and generate a GNU .pot (Portable Object Template) format file on standard output with entries for all localizable strings in the program. The program itself is not executed. See the GNU gettext distribution for more information on .pot files.
  - names:
      - -h
      - --help
    argument: ""
    description: Print a relatively short summary of the available options on the standard output. (Per the GNU Coding Standards, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.)
  - names:
      - -i
      - --include
    argument: include-file
    description: Load an awk source library. This searches for the library using the AWKPATH environment variable. If the initial search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the .awk suffix. The file will be loaded only once (i.e., duplicates are eliminated), and the code does not constitute the main program source. Files read with --include are treated as if they begin with an implicit @namespace "awk" statement.
  - names:
      - -l
      - --load
    argument: lib
    description: Load a gawk extension from the shared library lib. This searches for the library using the AWKLIBPATH environment variable. If the initial search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the default shared library suffix for the platform. The library initialization routine is expected to be named dl_load().
  - names:
      - -L
      - --lint
    argument: '[value]'
    description: Provide warnings about constructs that are dubious or non-portable to other AWK implementations. With an optional argument of fatal, lint warnings become fatal errors. This may be drastic, but its use will certainly encourage the development of cleaner AWK programs. With an optional argument of invalid, only warnings about things that are actually invalid are issued. (This is not fully implemented yet.) With an optional argument of no-ext, warnings about gawk extensions are disabled.
  - names:
      - -M
      - --bignum
    argument: ""
    description: Force arbitrary precision arithmetic on numbers. This option has no effect if gawk is not compiled to use the GNU MPFR and GMP libraries. (In such a case, gawk issues a warning.)
  - names:
      - -n
      - --non-decimal-data
    argument: ""
    description: Recognize octal and hexadecimal values in input data. Use this option with great caution!
  - names:
      - -N
      - --use-lc-numeric
    argument: ""
    description: Force gawk to use the locale's decimal point character when parsing input data. Although the POSIX standard requires this behavior, and gawk does so when --posix is in effect, the default is to follow traditional behavior and use a period as the decimal point, even in locales where the period is not the decimal point character. This option overrides the default behavior, without the full draconian strictness of the --posix option.
  - names:
      - -o
      - --pretty-print
    argument: '[file]'
    description: Output a pretty printed version of the program to file. If no file is provided, gawk uses a file named awkprof.out in the current directory. This option implies --no-optimize.
  - names:
      - -O
      - --optimize
    argument: ""
    description: Enable gawk's default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program. Currently, this just includes simple constant folding. This option is on by default.
  - names:
      - -p
      - --profile
    argument: '[prof-file]'
    description: Start a profiling session, and send the profiling data to prof-file. The default is awkprof.out. The profile contains execution counts of each statement in the program in the left margin and function call counts for each user-defined function. This option implies --no-optimize.
  - names:
      - -P
      - --posix
    argument: ""
    description: 'This turns on compatibility mode, with the following additional restrictions:'
  - names:
      - -r
      - --re-interval
    argument: ""
    description: Enable the use of interval expressions in regular expression matching (see Regular Expressions, below). Interval expressions were not traditionally available in the AWK language. The POSIX standard added them, to make awk and egrep consistent with each other. They are enabled by default, but this option remains for use together with --traditional.
  - names:
      - -s
      - --no-optimize
    argument: ""
    description: Disable gawk's default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.
  - names:
      - -S
      - --sandbox
    argument: ""
    description: Run gawk in sandbox mode, disabling the system() function, input redirection with getline, output redirection with print and printf, and loading dynamic extensions. Command execution (through pipelines) is also disabled. This effectively blocks a script from accessing local resources, except for the files specified on the command line.
  - names:
      - -t
      - --lint-old
    argument: ""
    description: Provide warnings about constructs that are not portable to the original version of UNIX awk.
  - names:
      - -V
      - --version
    argument: ""
    description: Print version information for this particular copy of gawk on the standard output. This is useful mainly for knowing if the current copy of gawk on your system is up to date with respect to whatever the Free Software Foundation is distributing. This is also useful when reporting bugs. (Per the GNU Coding Standards, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.)

  `awk -F ',' '{print $NF}' {{filename}}`

  - Sum the values in the first column of a file and print the total:

  `awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' {{filename}}`

  - Print every third line starting from the first line:

  `awk 'NR%3==1' {{filename}}`

  - Print different values based on conditions:

  `awk '{if ($1 == "foo") print "Exact match foo"; else if ($1 ~ "bar") print "Partial match bar"; else print "Baz"}' {{filename}}`

  - Print all lines where the 10th column value equals the specified value:

  `awk '($10 == value)'`

  - Print all the lines which the 10th column value is between a min and a max:
