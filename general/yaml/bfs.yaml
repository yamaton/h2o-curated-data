  - Find files by extension:

  `bfs {{root_path}} -name '{{*.ext}}'`

  - Find files matching multiple path/name patterns:

  `bfs {{root_path}} -path '{{**/path/**/*.ext}}' -or -name '{{*pattern*}}'`

  - Find directories matching a given name, in case-insensitive mode:

  `bfs {{root_path}} -type d -iname '{{*lib*}}'`

  - Find files matching a given pattern, excluding specific paths:

  `bfs {{root_path}} -name '{{*.py}}' -not -path '{{*/site-packages/*}}'`

  - Find files matching a given size range, limiting the recursive depth to "1":

  `bfs {{root_path}} -maxdepth 1 -size {{+500k}} -size {{-10M}}`

  - Run a command for each file (use `{}` within the command to access the filename):

  `bfs {{root_path}} -name '{{*.ext}}' -exec {{wc -l}} {} \;`

  - Find all files modified today and pass the results to a single command as arguments:

  `bfs {{root_path}} -daystart -mtime {{-1}} -exec {{tar -cvf archive.tar}} {} \+`

  - Find empty files (0 byte) or directories and delete them verbosely:

  `bfs {{root_path}} -type {{f|d}} -empty -delete -print`
