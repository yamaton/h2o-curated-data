  > A Python auto code formatter.
  > More information: <https://github.com/psf/black>.

  - Auto-format a file or entire directory:

  `black {{path/to/file_or_directory}}`

  - Format the code passed in as a string:

  `black -c "{{code}}"`

  - Output the changes that would be applied for each file:

  `black --diff {{path/to/file_or_directory}}`

  - Perform a dry run (print what would be done without actually doing it):

  `black --check {{path/to/file_or_directory}}`

  - Auto-format a file or directory emitting exclusively error messages to stderr:

  `black --quiet {{path/to/file_or_directory}}`

  - Auto-format a file or directory without replacing single quotes with double quotes (adoption helper, avoid using this for new projects):

  `black --skip-string-normalization {{path/to/file_or_directory}}`
