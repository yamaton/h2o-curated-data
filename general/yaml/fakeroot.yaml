options:
  - names:
      - -l
      - --lib
    argument: library
    description: Specify an alternative wrapper library.
  - names:
      - --faked
    argument: binary
    description: Specify an alternative binary to use as faked.
  - names:
      - -s
    argument: save-file
    description: Save the fakeroot environment to save-file on exit. This file can be used to restore the environment later using -i. However, this file will leak and fakeroot will behave in odd ways unless you leave the files touched inside the fakeroot alone when outside the environment. Still, this can be useful. For example, it can be used with rsync(1) to back up and restore whole directory trees complete with user, group and device information without needing to be root. See /usr/share/doc/fakeroot/README.saving for more details.
  - names:
      - -i
    argument: load-file
    description: Load a fakeroot environment previously saved using -s from load-file. Note that this does not implicitly save the file, use -s as well for that behaviour. Using the same file for both -i and -s in a single fakeroot invocation is safe.
  - names:
      - -u
      - --unknown-is-real
    argument: ""
    description: Use the real ownership of files previously unknown to fakeroot instead of pretending they are owned by root:root.
  - names:
      - -b
    argument: fd
    description: Specify fd base (TCP mode only). fd is the minimum file descriptor number to use for TCP connections; this may be important to avoid conflicts with the file descriptors used by the programs being run under fakeroot.
  - names:
      - -h
    argument: ""
