options:
  - names:
      - -H
      - --hidden
    argument: ""
    description: 'Include hidden files and directories in the search results (default: hidden files and directories are skipped). The flag can be overridden with ''--no-hidden''.'
  - names:
      - -I
      - --no-ignore
    argument: ""
    description: Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by '.gitignore', '.ignore', '.fdignore', or the global ignore file.
  - names:
      - -u
      - --unrestricted
    argument: ""
    description: Perform an unrestricted search, including ignored and hidden files. This is an alias for '--hidden --no-ignore'.
  - names:
      - --no-ignore-vcs
    argument: ""
    description: Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by gitignore files including .gitignore, .git/info/exclude, and the global gitignore configuration (core.excludesFile git setting, which defaults to $HOME/.config/git/ignore). The flag can be overridden with '--ignore-vcs'.
  - names:
      - --no-ignore-parent
    argument: ""
    description: Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by gitignore files in parent directories.
  - names:
      - -s
      - --case-sensitive
    argument: ""
    description: Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).
  - names:
      - -i
      - --ignore-case
    argument: ""
    description: Perform a case-insensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).
  - names:
      - -g
      - --glob
    argument: ""
    description: Perform a glob-based search instead of a regular expression search. If combined with the '--full-path' option, '**' can be used to match multiple path components.
  - names:
      - --regex
    argument: ""
    description: Perform a regular-expression based search (default). This can be used to override --glob.
  - names:
      - -F
      - --fixed-strings
    argument: ""
    description: Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. Note that this also performs substring comparison. If you want to match on an exact filename, consider using '--glob'.
  - names:
      - -a
      - --absolute-path
    argument: ""
    description: Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed to relative paths. The flag can be overridden with '--relative-path'.
  - names:
      - -l
      - --list-details
    argument: ""
    description: Use a detailed listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an alias for '--exec-batch ls -l' with some additional 'ls' options. This can be used to see more metadata, to show symlink targets and to achieve a deterministic sort order.
  - names:
      - -L
      - --follow
    argument: ""
    description: By default, fd does not descend into symlinked directories. Using this flag, symbolic links are also traversed. The flag can be overridden with '--no-follow'.
  - names:
      - -p
      - --full-path
    argument: ""
    description: By default, the search pattern is only matched against the filename (or directory name). Using this flag, the pattern is matched against the full path.
  - names:
      - "-0"
      - --print0
    argument: ""
    description: Separate search results by the null character (instead of newlines). Useful for piping results to xargs.
  - names:
      - --max-results
    argument: count
    description: Limit the number of search results to 'count' and quit immediately.
  - names:
      - "-1"
    argument: ""
    description: Limit the search to a single result and quit immediately. This is an alias for '--max-results=1'.
  - names:
      - -q
      - --quiet
    argument: ""
    description: When the flag is present, the program does not print anything and will instead exit with a code of 0 if there is at least one search result. Otherwise, the exit code will be 1. This is mainly for usage in scripts and can be faster than checking for output because the search can be stopped early after the first match. --has-results can be used as an alias.
  - names:
      - --show-errors
    argument: ""
    description: Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations such as insufficient permissions or dead symlinks.
  - names:
      - --strip-cwd-prefix
    argument: ""
    description: By default, relative paths are prefixed with './' when the output goes to a non interactive terminal (TTY). Use this flag to disable this behaviour.
  - names:
      - --one-file-system
      - --mount
      - --xdev
    argument: ""
    description: By default, fd will traverse the file system tree as far as other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that it does not descend into a different file system than the one it started in. Comparable to the -mount or -xdev filters of find(1).
  - names:
      - -h
      - --help
    argument: ""
    description: Print help information.
  - names:

  - names:
      - --min-depth
    argument: d
    description: 'Only show search results starting at the given depth. See also: ''--max-depth'' and ''--exact-depth''.'
  - names:
      - --exact-depth
    argument: d
    description: Only show search results at the exact given depth. This is an alias for '--min-depth <depth> --max-depth <depth>'.

    argument: date|duration
    description: Filter results based on the file modification time. Files with modification times greater than the argument will be returned. The argument can be provided as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min) or as a specific point in time in either full RFC3339 format with time zone, or as a date or datetime in the local time zone (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). --change-newer-than can be used as an alias.
  - names:
      - --changed-before
    argument: date|duration
    description: Filter results based on the file modification time. Files with modification times less than the argument will be returned. The argument can be provided as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min) or as a specific point in time in either full RFC3339 format with time zone, or as a date or datetime in the local time zone (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). --change-older-than can be used as an alias.

      - --owner
    argument: '[user][:group]'
    description: 'Filter files by their user and/or group. Format: [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)]. Either side is optional. Precede either side with a ''!'' to exclude files instead.'
  - names:
      - --base-directory
    argument: path
    description: Change the current working directory of fd to the provided path. This means that search results will be shown with respect to the given base path. Note that relative paths which are passed to fd via the positional path argument or the --search-path option will also be resolved relative to this directory.
  - names:
      - --path-separator
    argument: separator
    description: Set the path separator to use when printing file paths. The default is the OS-specific separator ('/' on Unix, '\' on Windows).

    argument: size
    description: Maximum number of arguments to pass to the command given with -X. If the number of results is greater than the given size, the command given with -X is run again with remaining arguments. A batch size of zero means there is no limit (default), but note that batching might still happen due to OS restrictions on the maximum length of command lines.

  > An alternative to `find`.
  > Aims to be faster and easier to use than `find`.
  > More information: <https://github.com/sharkdp/fd>.

  - Recursively find files matching the given pattern in the current directory:

  `fd {{pattern}}`

  - Find files that begin with `foo`:

  `fd '^foo'`

  - Find files with a specific extension:

  `fd --extension txt`

  - Find files in a specific directory:

  `fd '{{pattern}}' {{path/to/directory}}`

  - Include ignored and hidden files in the search:

  `fd --hidden --no-ignore '{{pattern}}'`

  - Execute a command on each search result returned:

  `fd '{{pattern}}' --exec {{command}}`
