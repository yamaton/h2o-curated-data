  - names:
      - -m
    argument: pattern
    description: Print out all fortunes which match the basic regular expression pattern. The syntax of these expressions depends on how your system defines re_comp(3) or regcomp(3), but it should nevertheless be similar to the syntax used in grep(1).
  - names:
      - -n
    argument: length
    description: Set the longest fortune length (in characters) considered to be ``short'' (the default is 160). All fortunes longer than this are considered ``long''. Be careful! If you set the length too short and ask for short fortunes, or too long and ask for long ones, fortune goes into a never-ending thrash loop.
