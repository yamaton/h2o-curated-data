  - Check filesystem `/dev/sdXN`, reporting any damaged blocks:

  `sudo fsck {{/dev/sdXN}}`

  - Check filesystem `/dev/sdXN`, reporting any damaged blocks and interactively letting the user choose to repair each one:

  `sudo fsck -r {{/dev/sdXN}}`

  - Check filesystem `/dev/sdXN`, reporting any damaged blocks and automatically repairing them:

  `sudo fsck -a {{/dev/sdXN}}`
