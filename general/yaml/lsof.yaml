options:
  - names:
      - -?
      - -h
    argument: ""
    description: These two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list. Lsof displays a shortened form of this output when it detects an error in the options supplied to it, after it has displayed messages explaining each error. (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)

  - names:
      - -A
    argument: A
    description: is available on systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel code is implemented via dynamic modules. It allows the lsof user to specify A as an alternate name list file where the kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be found. See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.) for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect lsof.

    argument: s
    description: specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or include in the output listing. The file descriptors are specified in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``cwd,1,3'', ``^6,^2''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)
  - names:
      - -D
    argument: D
    description: directs lsof's use of the device cache file. The use of this option is sometimes restricted. See the DEVICE CACHE FILE section and the sections that follow it for more information on this option.
  - names:
      - -F
    argument: f
    description: specifies a character list, f, that selects the fields to be output for processing by another program, and the character that terminates each output field. Each field to be output is specified with a single character in f. The field terminator defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL (000). See the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for a description of the field identification characters and the field output process.

    argument: ""
    description: selects the listing of NFS files.
  - names:
      - -o
    argument: o

  - names:
      - -O
    argument: ""
    description: directs lsof to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked child processes. See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS sections for more information on kernel operations that may block lsof.
  - names:
      - -p
    argument: s
    description: excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)
  - names:
      - -P
    argument: ""
    description: inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files. Inhibiting the conversion may make lsof run a little faster. It is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.
  - names:
      - -R
    argument: ""
    description: directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.
  - names:
      - -s
    argument: '[p:s]'

  - names:
      - -S
    argument: '[t]'
    description: specifies an optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) - that might otherwise deadlock. The minimum for t is two; the default, fifteen; when no value is specified, the default is used.

  - Find the processes that have a given file open:

  `lsof {{path/to/file}}`
