  - names:
      - -a
    argument: array
    description: assign the words read to sequential indices of the array variable ARRAY, starting at zero
  - names:
      - -d
    argument: delim
    description: continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather than newline
  - names:
      - -e
    argument: ""
    description: use Readline to obtain the line
  - names:
      - -i
    argument: text
    description: use TEXT as the initial text for Readline
  - names:
      - -n
    argument: nchars
    description: return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting for a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than NCHARS characters are read before the delimiter
  - names:
      - -N
    argument: nchars
    description: return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any delimiter
  - names:
      - -p
    argument: prompt
    description: output the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before attempting to read
  - names:
      - -r
    argument: ""
    description: do not allow backslashes to escape any characters
  - names:
      - -s

    description: do not echo input coming from a terminal
  - names:
      - -t
    argument: timeout
    description: time out and return failure if a complete line of input is not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the TMOUT variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns immediately, without trying to read any data, returning success only if input is available on the specified file descriptor.  The exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded
  - names:
      - -u
    argument: fd
    description: read from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input

  - Store data that you type from the keyboard:

  `read {{variable}}`

  - Store each of the next lines you enter as values of an array:

  `read -a {{array}}`

  - Specify the number of maximum characters to be read:

  `read -n {{character_count}} {{variable}}`

  - Use a specific character as a delimiter instead of a new line:

  `read -d {{new_delimiter}} {{variable}}`

  - Do not let backslash (\) act as an escape character:

  `read -r {{variable}}`

  - Display a prompt before the input:

  `read -p "{{Enter your input here: }}" {{variable}}`

  - Do not echo typed characters (silent mode):

  `read -s {{variable}}`

  - Read stdin and perform an action on every line:

  `while read line; do echo "$line"; done`
