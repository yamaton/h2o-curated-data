This filter is applied after these other filters: ''--exclude'' options, any filtering done by git (or other SCM), and filtering by ''.semgrepignore'' files. Multiple ''--include'' options can be specified. A file path is selected if it matches at least one of the include patterns. PATTERN is a glob-style pattern such as ''foo.*'' that must match the path. For example, specifying the language with ''-l javascript'' might preselect files ''src/foo.jsx'' and ''lib/bar.js''. Specifying one of ''--include=src'', ''--include=*.jsx'', or ''--include=src/foo.*'' will restrict the selection to the single file ''src/foo.jsx''. A choice of multiple ''--include'' patterns can be specified. For example, ''--include=foo.* --include=bar.*'' will select both ''src/foo.jsx'' and ''lib/bar.js''. Glob-style patterns follow the syntax supported by gitignore and semgrepignore, which is documented at https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format'

        argument: VAL
        description: Degree of parallelism to use for parallel scanning, either using shared-memory threads (the default) or the legacy process-based parallelism (enabled with the deprecated --x-parmap flag). Semgrep recommends under-provisioning the job count by 10-15 percent to account for overhead from the garbage collector managing the shared heap (for example, on a 12-core box, a -j value of 10 or 11 would be considered a good starting value). We highly recommend that users do not _oversubscribe_ threads to CPUs, since this has been seen to induce significant GC latency and slow scan times. (Doing so will log a warning in debug mode.) The default jobs value is derived from the number of logical cores that are detected by Semgrep, scaled by 0.85.
