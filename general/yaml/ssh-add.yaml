    argument: ""
    description: Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation before being used for authentication. Confirmation is performed by ssh-askpass(1). Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero exit status from ssh-askpass(1), rather than text entered into the requester.

    argument: ""
    description: Deletes all identities from the agent.
  - names:
      - -d
    argument: ""
    description: Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent. If ssh-add has been run without arguments, the keys for the default identities and their corresponding certificates will be removed. Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certificates to be removed from the agent. If no public key is found at a given path, ssh-add will append .pub and retry. If the argument list consists of “-” then ssh-add will read public keys to be removed from standard input.

    argument: fingerprint_hash
    description: 'Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are: “md5” and “sha256”. The default is “sha256”.'

    argument: hostkey_file
    description: 'Specifies a known hosts file to look up hostkeys when using destination-constrained keys via the -h flag. This option may be specified multiple times to allow multiple files to be searched. If no files are specified, ssh-add will use the default ssh_config(5) known hosts files: ~/.ssh/known_hosts, ~/.ssh/known_hosts2, /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2.'

    argument: ""
    description: Verbose mode. Causes ssh-add to print debugging messages about its progress. This is helpful in debugging problems. Multiple -v options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3.

  - Add the default ssh keys in `~/.ssh` to the ssh-agent:

  `ssh-add`

  - Add a specific key to the ssh-agent:

  `ssh-add {{path/to/private_key}}`

  - List fingerprints of currently loaded keys:

  `ssh-add -l`

  - Delete a key from the ssh-agent:

  `ssh-add -d {{path/to/private_key}}`

  - Delete all currently loaded keys from the ssh-agent:

  `ssh-add -D`

  - Add a key to the ssh-agent and the keychain:

  `ssh-add -K {{path/to/private_key}}`
