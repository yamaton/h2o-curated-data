    argument: ""
    description: Force IPv6 address resolution.
  - names:
      - "-8"
    argument: ""
    description: Request 8-bit operation. This causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option for both input and output. By default telnet is not 8-bit clean.

  - names:

  - names:
      - -a
    argument: ""
    description: Attempt automatic login. Currently, this sends the user name via the USER variable of the NEW-ENVIRON option if supported by the remote system. The username is retrieved via getlogin(3).

  - names:
      - -r
    argument: ""
    description: 'Emulate rlogin(1). In this mode, the default escape character is a tilde. Also, the interpretation of the escape character is changed: an escape character followed by a dot causes telnet to disconnect from the remote host. A ^Z instead of a dot suspends telnet, and a ^] (the default telnet escape character) generates a normal telnet prompt. These codes are accepted only at the beginning of a line.'
  - names:
      - -S
    argument: tos
    description: Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connection to the value tos.
  - names:

    argument: escapechar
    description: Sets the escape character to escapechar. If no character is supplied, no escape character will be used. Entering the escape character while connected causes telnet to drop to command mode.
  - names:
      - -l
    argument: user
    description: Specify user as the user to log in as on the remote system. This is accomplished by sending the specified name as the USER environment variable, so it requires that the remote system support the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON option. This option implies the -a option, and may also be used with the open command.
  - names:
      - -n
    argument: tracefile
    description: Opens tracefile for recording trace information. See the set tracefile command below.
