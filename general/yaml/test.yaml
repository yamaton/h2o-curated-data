  - Test if a given variable is equal to a given string:

  `test "{{$MY_VAR}}" == "{{/bin/zsh}}"`

  - Test if a given variable is empty:

  `test -z "{{$GIT_BRANCH}}"`

  - Test if a file exists:

  `test -f "{{path/to/file_or_directory}}"`

  - Test if a directory does not exist:

  `test ! -d "{{path/to/directory}}"`

  - If A is true, then do B, or C in the case of an error (notice that C may run even if A fails):

  `test {{condition}} && {{echo "true"}} || {{echo "false"}}`
