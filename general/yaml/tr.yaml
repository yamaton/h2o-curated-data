  - Replace all occurrences of a character in a file, and print the result:

  `tr {{find_character}} {{replace_character}} < {{filename}}`

  - Replace all occurrences of a character from another command's output:

  `echo {{text}} | tr {{find_character}} {{replace_character}}`

  - Map each character of the first set to the corresponding character of the second set:

  `tr '{{abcd}}' '{{jkmn}}' < {{filename}}`

  - Delete all occurrences of the specified set of characters from the input:

  `tr -d '{{input_characters}}' < {{filename}}`

  - Compress a series of identical characters to a single character:

  `tr -s '{{input_characters}}' < {{filename}}`

  - Translate the contents of a file to upper-case:

  `tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" < {{filename}}`

  - Strip out non-printable characters from a file:

  `tr -cd "[:print:]" < {{filename}}`
