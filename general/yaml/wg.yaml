  - Check status of currently active interfaces:

  `wg`

  - Generate a new private key:

  `wg genkey`

  - Generate a public key from a private key:

  `wg pubkey < {{path/to/private_key}} > {{path/to/public_key}}`

  - Generate a public and private key:

  `wg genkey | tee {{path/to/private_key}} | wg pubkey > {{path/to/public_key}}`

  - Show the current configuration of a wireguard interface:

  `wg showconf {{wg0}}`
