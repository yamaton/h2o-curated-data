This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system'\''s dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually means using dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the offending packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce an error in some situations. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.]' \

Use of this option together with -f may produce an error in some situations. If a package is selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the command line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing.]' \

You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the configuration file. Note that quiet level 2 implies -y; you should never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as APT may decide to do something you did not expect. Configuration Item: quiet.]' \

Locking will be disabled (Debug::NoLocking) so the system state could change while apt-get is running. Simulations can also be executed by non-root users which might not have read access to all apt configuration distorting the simulation.

Instead of holding the package back upgrade will upgrade the package and install the new dependencies. Note that upgrade with this option will never remove packages, only allow adding new ones.

Note that the file name to write to will not always match the file name on the remote site! This also works with the source and update commands. When used with the update command the MD5 and size are not included, and it is up to the user to decompress any compressed files. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Print-URIs.]' \

The only reason to turn it off is if you frequently change your sources list. Configuration Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup.]' \

This overrides the general settings in /etc/apt/preferences. Specifically pinned packages are not affected by the value of this option. In short, this option lets you have simple control over which distribution packages will be retrieved from. Some common examples might be -t '\''2.1*'\'', -t unstable or -t sid. Configuration Item: APT::Default-Release; see also the apt_preferences(5) manual page.]' \

This can be useful while working with local repositories, but is a huge security risk if data authenticity isn'\''t ensured in another way by the user itself. The usage of the Trusted option for sources.list(5) entries should usually be preferred over this global override. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.]' \

APT will fail at the update command for repositories without valid cryptographically signatures. See also apt-secure(8) for details on the concept and the implications. Configuration Item: Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories.]' \
