        '--preview[Enable potentially disruptive style changes that may be added to Black'\''s main functionality in the next major release.]' \
        '--check[Don'\''t write the files back, just return the status. Return code 0 means nothing would change. Return code 1 means some files would be reformatted. Return code 123 means there was an internal error.]' \
