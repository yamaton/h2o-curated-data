    _arguments -C \
        '--version[Print the program version and licensing information. Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.]' \
        {--help,-h}'[Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line options. Note that you cannot arbitrarily abbreviate this command (though you can use its short form -h).]' \
        '--warranty[Print warranty information.]' \
        '--dump-options[Print a list of all available options and commands. Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.]' \
        {--sign,-s}'[Sign a message. This command may be combined with --encrypt (to sign and encrypt a message), --symmetric (to sign and symmetrically encrypt a message), or both --encrypt and --symmetric (to sign and encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase). The signing key is chosen by default or can be set explicitly using the --local-user and --default-key options.]' \
        {--clear-sign,--clearsign}'[Make a cleartext signature. The content in a cleartext signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP software is only needed to verify the signature. cleartext signatures may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to be reversible. The signing key is chosen by default or can be set explicitly using the --local-user and --default-key options.]' \
        {--detach-sign,-b}'[Make a detached signature.]' \
        {--encrypt,-e}'[Encrypt data to one or more public keys. This command may be combined with --sign (to sign and encrypt a message), --symmetric (to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and --symmetric together (for a signed message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase). --recipient and related options specify which public keys to use for encryption.]' \
        {--symmetric,-c}'[Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the --cipher-algo option. This command may be combined with --sign (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), --encrypt (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and --encrypt together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). gpg caches the passphrase used for symmetric encryption so that a decrypt operation may not require that the user needs to enter the passphrase. The option --no-symkey-cache can be used to disable this feature.]' \
        '--store[Store only (make a simple literal data packet).]' \
        {--decrypt,-d}'[Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with --output). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects files that don'\''t begin with an encrypted message.]' \
        '--verify[Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it without generating any output. With no arguments, the signature packet is read from STDIN. If only one argument is given, the specified file is expected to include a complete signature.]' \
        '--multifile[This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each filename on a separate line. This allows for many files to be processed at once. --multifile may currently be used along with --verify, --encrypt, and --decrypt. Note that --multifile --verify may not be used with detached signatures.]' \
        '--verify-files[Identical to --multifile --verify.]' \
        '--encrypt-files[Identical to --multifile --encrypt.]' \
        '--decrypt-files[Identical to --multifile --decrypt.]' \
        {--list-keys,-k,--list-public-keys}'[List the specified keys. If no keys are specified, then all keys from the configured public keyrings are listed.]' \
        {--list-secret-keys,-K}'[List the specified secret keys. If no keys are specified, then all known secret keys are listed. A # after the initial tags sec or ssb means that the secret key or subkey is currently not usable. We also say that this key has been taken offline (for example, a primary key can be taken offline by exporting the key using the command --export-secret-subkeys). A > after these tags indicate that the key is stored on a smartcard. See also --list-keys.]' \
        {--check-signatures,--check-sigs}'[Same as --list-keys, but the key signatures are verified and listed too. Note that for performance reasons the revocation status of a signing key is not shown. This command has the same effect as using --list-keys with --with-sig-check.]' \
        {--locate-keys,--locate-external-keys}'[Locate the keys given as arguments. This command basically uses the same algorithm as used when locating keys for encryption or signing and may thus be used to see what keys gpg might use. In particular external methods as defined by --auto-key-locate may be used to locate a key. Only public keys are listed. The variant --locate-external-keys does not consider a locally existing key and can thus be used to force the refresh of a key via the defined external methods.]' \
        '--show-keys[This commands takes OpenPGP keys as input and prints information about them in the same way the command --list-keys does for locally stored key. In addition the list options show-unusable-uids, show-unusable-subkeys, show-notations and show-policy-urls are also enabled. As usual for automated processing, this command should be combined with the option --with-colons.]' \
        '--fingerprint[List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints. This is the same output as --list-keys but with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be combined with --check-signatures. If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too. This command also forces pretty printing of fingerprints if the keyid format has been set to "none".]' \
        '--list-packets[List only the sequence of packets. This command is only useful for debugging. When used with option --verbose the actual MPI values are dumped and not only their lengths. Note that the output of this command may change with new releases.]' \
        {--edit-card,--card-edit}'[Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help" provides an overview on available commands. For a detailed description, please see the Card HOWTO at https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO .]' \
        '--card-status[Show the content of the smart card.]' \
        '--change-pin[Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This functionality is also available as the subcommand "passwd" with the --edit-card command.]' \
        '--delete-keys[Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either --yes is required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys. If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey only that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key the entire public key is deleted.]' \
        '--delete-secret-keys[Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. The option --yes can be used to advice gpg-agent not to request a confirmation. This extra pre-caution is done because gpg can'\''t be sure that the secret key (as controlled by gpg-agent) is only used for the given OpenPGP public key. If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey only the secret part of that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key only the secret part of the primary key is deleted.]' \
        '--delete-secret-and-public-key[Same as --delete-key, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. The option --yes can be used to advice gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.]' \
        '--export[Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and those registered via option --keyring), or if at least one name is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option --output. Use together with --armor to mail those keys.]' \
        '--send-keys[Similar to --export but sends the keys to a keyserver. Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Don'\''t send your complete keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new or changed by you. If no keyIDs are given, gpg does nothing.]' \
        {--export-secret-keys,--export-secret-subkeys}'[Same as --export, but exports the secret keys instead. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option --output. This command is often used along with the option --armor to allow for easy printing of the key for paper backup; however the external tool paperkey does a better job of creating backups on paper. Note that exporting a secret key can be a security risk if the exported keys are sent over an insecure channel.]' \
        '--export-ssh-key[This command is used to export a key in the OpenSSH public key format. It requires the specification of one key by the usual means and exports the latest valid subkey which has an authentication capability to STDOUT or to the file given with option --output. That output can directly be added to ssh'\''s ‘authorized_key’ file.]' \
        {--import,--fast-import}'[Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently just a synonym.]' \
        {--receive-keys,--recv-keys}'[Import the keys with the given keyIDs from a keyserver.]' \
        '--refresh-keys[Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments will refresh the entire keyring.]' \
        '--search-keys[Search the keyserver for the given names. Multiple names given here will be joined together to create the search string for the keyserver. Note that keyservers search for names in a different and simpler way than gpg does. The best choice is to use a mail address. Due to data privacy reasons keyservers may even not even allow searching by user id or mail address and thus may only return results when being used with the --recv-key command to search by key fingerprint or keyid.]' \
        '--fetch-keys[Retrieve keys located at the specified URIs. Note that different installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.). When using HTTPS the system provided root certificates are used by this command.]' \
        '--update-trustdb[Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys. The user has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to a key. Using the --edit-key menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time.]' \
        '--check-trustdb[Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time to time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do it automatically unless --no-auto-check-trustdb is set. This command can be used to force a trust database check at any time. The processing is identical to that of --update-trustdb but it skips keys with a not yet defined "ownertrust".]' \
        '--export-ownertrust[Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values are the only ones which can'\''t be re-created from a corrupted trustdb. Example:]' \
        '--import-ownertrust[Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in files (or STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten. In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file ‘otrust.txt’), you may re-create the trustdb using these commands:]' \
        '--rebuild-keydb-caches[When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations too.]' \
        {--print-md,--print-mds}'[Print message digest of algorithm algo for all given files or STDIN. With the second form (or a deprecated "*" for algo) digests for all available algorithms are printed.]' \
        '--gen-random[Emit count random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If count is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted. If used with --armor the output will be base64 encoded. PLEASE, don'\''t use this command unless you know what you are doing; it may remove precious entropy from the system!]' \
        '--gen-prime[Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is subject to change with ant release.]' \
        {--enarmor,--dearmor}'[Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not very useful.]' \
        '--tofu-policy[Set the TOFU policy for all the bindings associated with the specified keys. For more information about the meaning of the policies, see: \[trust-model-tofu\]. The keys may be specified either by their fingerprint (preferred) or their keyid.]' \
        {--quick-generate-key,--quick-gen-key}'[This is a simple command to generate a standard key with one user id. In contrast to --generate-key the key is generated directly without the need to answer a bunch of prompts. Unless the option --yes is given, the key creation will be canceled if the given user id already exists in the keyring.]' \
        '--quick-set-expire[With two arguments given, directly set the expiration time of the primary key identified by fpr to expire. To remove the expiration time 0 can be used. With three arguments and the third given as an asterisk, the expiration time of all non-revoked and not yet expired subkeys are set to expire. With more than two arguments and a list of fingerprints given for subfprs, all non-revoked subkeys matching these fingerprints are set to expire.]' \
        '--quick-add-key[Directly add a subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint fpr. Without the optional arguments an encryption subkey is added. If any of the arguments are given a more specific subkey is added.]' \
        {--generate-key,--gen-key}'[Generate a new key pair using the current default parameters. This is the standard command to create a new key. In addition to the key a revocation certificate is created and stored in the ‘openpgp-revocs.d’ directory below the GnuPG home directory.]' \
        {--full-generate-key,--full-gen-key}'[Generate a new key pair with dialogs for all options. This is an extended version of --generate-key.]' \
        {--generate-revocation,--gen-revoke}'[Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key. To only revoke a subkey or a key signature, use the --edit command.]' \
        {--generate-designated-revocation,--desig-revoke}'[Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone else'\''s key.]' \
        '--edit-key[Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key management related tasks. It expects the specification of a key on the command line.]' \
        '--sign-key[Signs a public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut version of the subcommand "sign" from --edit.]' \
        '--lsign-key[Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as non-exportable. This is a shortcut version of the subcommand "lsign" from --edit-key.]' \
        {--quick-sign-key,--quick-lsign-key}'[Directly sign a key from the passphrase without any further user interaction. The fpr must be the verified primary fingerprint of a key in the local keyring. If no names are given, all useful user ids are signed; with given \[names\] only useful user ids matching one of theses names are signed. By default, or if a name is prefixed with a '\''*'\'', a case insensitive substring match is used. If a name is prefixed with a '\''='\'' a case sensitive exact match is done.]' \
        '--quick-add-uid[This command adds a new user id to an existing key. In contrast to the interactive sub-command adduid of --edit-key the new-user-id is added verbatim with only leading and trailing white space removed, it is expected to be UTF-8 encoded, and no checks on its form are applied.]' \
        '--quick-revoke-uid[This command revokes a user ID on an existing key. It cannot be used to revoke the last user ID on key (some non-revoked user ID must remain), with revocation reason ``User ID is no longer valid'\'''\''. If you want to specify a different revocation reason, or to supply supplementary revocation text, you should use the interactive sub-command revuid of --edit-key.]' \
        '--quick-set-primary-uid[This command sets or updates the primary user ID flag on an existing key. user-id specifies the key and primary-user-id the user ID which shall be flagged as the primary user ID. The primary user ID flag is removed from all other user ids and the timestamp of all affected self-signatures is set one second ahead.]' \
        {--change-passphrase,--passwd}'[Change the passphrase of the secret key belonging to the certificate specified as user-id. This is a shortcut for the sub-command passwd of the edit key menu. When using together with the option --dry-run this will not actually change the passphrase but check that the current passphrase is correct.]' \
        '--default-key[Use name as the default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring. Note that -u or --local-user overrides this option. This option may be given multiple times. In this case, the last key for which a secret key is available is used. If there is no secret key available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will not emit an error message but continue as if this option wasn'\''t given.]' \
        '--default-recipient[Use name as default recipient if option --recipient is not used and don'\''t ask if this is a valid one. name must be non-empty.]' \
        '--default-recipient-self[Use the default key as default recipient if option --recipient is not used and don'\''t ask if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with --default-key.]' \
        '--no-default-recipient[Reset --default-recipient and --default-recipient-self.]' \
        {-v,--verbose}'[Give more information during processing. If used twice, the input data is listed in detail.]' \
        '--no-verbose[Reset verbose level to 0.]' \
        {-q,--quiet}'[Try to be as quiet as possible.]' \
        {--batch,--no-batch}'[Use batch mode. Never ask, do not allow interactive commands. --no-batch disables this option. Note that even with a filename given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached signature and no data file has been specified). Thus if you do not want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to g‘/dev/null’.]' \
        '--no-tty[Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any output. This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG sometimes prints warnings to the TTY even if --batch is used.]' \
        '--yes[Assume "yes" on most questions.]' \
        '--no[Assume "no" on most questions.]' \
        '--list-options[This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when listing keys and signatures (that is, --list-keys, --check-signatures, --list-public-keys, --list-secret-keys, and the --edit-key functions). Options can be prepended with a no- (after the two dashes) to give the opposite meaning. The options are:]' \
        '--verify-options[This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when verifying signatures. Options can be prepended with a `no-'\'' to give the opposite meaning. The options are:]' \
        {--enable-large-rsa,--disable-large-rsa}'[With --generate-key and --batch, enable the creation of RSA secret keys as large as 8192 bit. Note: 8192 bit is more than is generally recommended. These large keys don'\''t significantly improve security, but they are more expensive to use, and their signatures and certifications are larger. This option is only available if the binary was build with large-secmem support.]' \
        {--enable-dsa2,--disable-dsa2}'[Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to 1024 bit. This is also the default with --openpgp. Note that older versions of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit.]' \
        '--photo-viewer[This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID. "%i" will be expanded to a filename containing the photo. "%I" does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer exits. Other flags are "%k" for the key ID, "%K" for the long key ID, "%f" for the key fingerprint, "%t" for the extension of the image type (e.g. "jpg"), "%T" for the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg"), "%v" for the single-character calculated validity of the image being viewed (e.g. "f"), "%V" for the calculated validity as a string (e.g. "full"), "%U" for a base32 encoded hash of the user ID, and "%%" for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or %I are present, then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input.]' \
        '--exec-path[Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers If not provided photo viewers use the PATH environment variable.]' \
        '--keyring[Add file to the current list of keyrings. If file begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not used).]':file:_files \
        '--secret-keyring[This is an obsolete option and ignored. All secret keys are stored in the ‘private-keys-v1.d’ directory below the GnuPG home directory.]':file:_files \
        '--primary-keyring[Designate file as the primary public keyring. This means that newly imported keys (via --import or keyserver --recv-from) will go to this keyring.]':file:_files \
        '--trustdb-name[Use file instead of the default trustdb. If file begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory (‘~/.gnupg’ if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not used).]':file:_files \
        '--homedir[Set the name of the home directory to dir. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’. It is only recognized when given on the command line. It also overrides any home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’ or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir.]':file:_files \
        '--display-charset[Set the name of the native character set. This is used to convert some informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note that this has nothing to do with the character set of data to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default character set is determined from the current locale. A verbosity level of 3 shows the chosen set. Valid values for name are:]' \
        {--utf8-strings,--no-utf8-strings}'[Assume that command line arguments are given as UTF-8 strings. The default (--no-utf8-strings) is to assume that arguments are encoded in the character set as specified by --display-charset. These options affect all following arguments. Both options may be used multiple times.]' \
        '--options[Read options from file and do not try to read them from the default options file in the homedir (see --homedir). This option is ignored if used in an options file.]':file:_files \
        '--no-options[Shortcut for --options /dev/null. This option is detected before an attempt to open an option file. Using this option will also prevent the creation of a ‘~/.gnupg’ homedir.]' \
        {-z,--compress-level,--bzip2-compress-level}'[Set compression level to n for the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The default is to use the default compression level of zlib (normally 6). --bzip2-compress-level sets the compression level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is a different option from --compress-level since BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional compression level. -z sets both. A value of 0 for n disables compression.]' \
        '--bzip2-decompress-lowmem[Use a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed files. This alternate method uses a bit more than half the memory, but also runs at half the speed. This is useful under extreme low memory circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a high --bzip2-compress-level.]' \
        {--mangle-dos-filenames,--no-mangle-dos-filenames}'[Older version of Windows cannot handle filenames with more than one dot. --mangle-dos-filenames causes GnuPG to replace (rather than add to) the extension of an output filename to avoid this problem. This option is off by default and has no effect on non-Windows platforms.]' \
        {--ask-cert-level,--no-ask-cert-level}'[When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level. If this option is not specified, the certification level used is set via --default-cert-level. See --default-cert-level for information on the specific levels and how they are used. --no-ask-cert-level disables this option. This option defaults to no.]' \
        '--default-cert-level[The default to use for the check level when signing a key.]' \
        '--min-cert-level[When building the trust database, treat any signatures with a certification level below this as invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level 1 signatures. Note that level 0 "no particular claim" signatures are always accepted.]' \
        '--trusted-key[Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is useful if you don'\''t want to keep your secret keys (or one of them) online but still want to be able to check the validity of a given recipient'\''s or signator'\''s key.]' \
        '--trust-model[Set what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:]':file:_files \
        {--auto-key-locate,--no-auto-key-locate}'[GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option. This happens when encrypting to an email address (in the "user@example.com" form), and there are no "user@example.com" keys on the local keyring. This option takes any number of the mechanisms listed below, in the order they are to be tried. Instead of listing the mechanisms as comma delimited arguments, the option may also be given several times to add more mechanism. The option --no-auto-key-locate or the mechanism "clear" resets the list. The default is "local,wkd".]' \
        {--auto-key-retrieve,--no-auto-key-retrieve}'[These options enable or disable the automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are not on the local keyring. The default is --no-auto-key-retrieve.]' \
        '--keyid-format[Select how to display key IDs. "none" does not show the key ID at all but shows the fingerprint in a separate line. "short" is the traditional 8-character key ID. "long" is the more accurate (but less convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an "0x" to either to include an "0x" at the beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560. Note that this option is ignored if the option --with-colons is used.]' \
        '--keyserver[This option is deprecated - please use the --keyserver in ‘dirmngr.conf’ instead.]' \
        '--keyserver-options[This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a `no-'\'' to give the opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be used here as well to apply to importing (--recv-key) or exporting (--send-key) a key from a keyserver. While not all options are available for all keyserver types, some common options are:]' \
        '--completes-needed[Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 1).]' \
        '--marginals-needed[Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 3)]' \
        '--tofu-default-policy[The default TOFU policy (defaults to auto). For more information about the meaning of this option, see: \[trust-model-tofu\].]' \
        '--max-cert-depth[Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).]' \
        '--no-sig-cache[Do not cache the verification status of key signatures. Caching gives a much better performance in key listings. However, if you suspect that your public keyring is not safe against write modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching.

        '--allow-freeform-uid[Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a new one. This option should only be used in very special environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs.]' \
        '--ignore-time-conflict[GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to clock problems. This option makes these checks just a warning. See also --ignore-valid-from for timestamp issues on subkeys.]' \
        '--ignore-valid-from[GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the future. This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option unless there is some clock problem. See also --ignore-time-conflict for timestamp issues with signatures.]' \
        '--ignore-crc-error[The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual content (which is protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay. This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.]' \
        '--ignore-mdc-error[This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a warning. It is required to decrypt old messages which did not use an MDC. It may also be useful if a message is partially garbled, but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of that garbled message. Be aware that a missing or failed MDC can be an indication of an attack. Use with great caution; see also option --rfc2440.]' \
        '--allow-weak-digest-algos[Signatures made with known-weak digest algorithms are normally rejected with an ``invalid digest algorithm'\'''\'' message. This option allows the verification of signatures made with such weak algorithms. MD5 is the only digest algorithm considered weak by default. See also --weak-digest to reject other digest algorithms.]' \
        '--weak-digest[Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak. Signatures made over weak digests algorithms are normally rejected. This option can be supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be considered weak. See also --allow-weak-digest-algos to disable rejection of weak digests. MD5 is always considered weak, and does not need to be listed explicitly.]' \

        '--no-default-keyring[Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if you use this option and do not provide alternate keyrings via --keyring or --secret-keyring, then GnuPG will still use the default public or secret keyrings.]' \

Note that in contrast to --check-signatures the key signatures are not verified. This command can be used to create a list of signing keys missing in the local keyring; for example:]' \
        '--fast-list-mode[Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts empty. Some applications don'\''t need the user ID and the trust information given in the listings. By using this options they can get a faster listing.

The format of this string is the same as the one printed by --show-session-key. This option is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the content of an encrypted message; using this option you can do this without handing out the secret key. Note that using --override-session-key may reveal the session key to all local users via the global process table. Often it is useful to combine this option with --no-keyring.]' \

        '--default-new-key-algo[This option can be used to change the default algorithms for key generation. The string is similar to the arguments required for the command --quick-add-key but slightly different. For example the current default of "rsa2048/cert,sign+rsa2048/encr" (or "rsa3072") can be changed to the value of what we currently call future default, which is "ed25519/cert,sign+cv25519/encr".
