    _arguments -C \
        '(-? --help)'{-?,--help}'[This option displays a summary of the commands accepted by less (the same as the h command).  (Depending on  how  your shell interprets the question mark, it may be necessary to quote the question mark, thus: "-\?".)]' \
        '(-a --search-skip-screen)'{-a,--search-skip-screen}'[By  default,  forward  searches start at the top of the displayed screen and backwards searches start at the bottom of the displayed screen (except for repeated searches invoked by the n or N commands, which start  after  or  before  the "target"  line respectively; see the -j option for more about the target line).  The -a option causes forward searches to instead start at the bottom of the screen and backward searches to start at the top of the  screen,  thus  skipping all lines displayed on the screen.]' \
        '(-A --SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN)'{-A,--SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN}'[Causes  all  forward  searches  (not just non-repeated searches) to start just after the target line, and all backward searches to start just before the target line.  Thus, forward searches will skip part of the  displayed  screen  (from the first line up to and including the target line).  Similarly backwards searches will skip the displayed screen from the last line up to and including the target line.  This was the default behavior in less versions prior to 441.]' \
        '(-b --buffers)'{-b,--buffers}'[Specifies the amount of buffer space less will use for each file, in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes).  By default 64 K of buffer space is used for each file (unless the file is a pipe; see the -B option).  The -b option specifies instead that n kilobytes of buffer space should be used for each file.  If n is -1, buffer space is unlimited;  that  is,  the entire file can be read into memory.]' \
        '(-B --auto-buffers)'{-B,--auto-buffers}'[By  default,  when data is read from a pipe, buffers are allocated automatically as needed.  If a large amount of data is read from the pipe, this can cause a large amount of memory to be allocated.  The -B option disables this automatic allocation of buffers for pipes, so that only 64 K (or the amount of space specified by the -b option) is used for the pipe.  Warning: use of -B can result in erroneous display, since only the most recently viewed part of the piped  data is kept in memory; any earlier data is lost.]' \
        '(-c --clear-screen)'{-c,--clear-screen}'[Causes  full  screen  repaints  to  be  painted  from the top line down.  By default, full screen repaints are done by scrolling from the bottom of the screen.]' \
        '(-C --CLEAR-SCREEN)'{-C,--CLEAR-SCREEN}'[Same as -c, for compatibility with older versions of less.]' \
        '(-d --dumb)'{-d,--dumb}'[The -d option suppresses the error message normally displayed if the terminal is dumb; that is, lacks  some  important capability,  such  as the ability to clear the screen or scroll backward.  The -d option does not otherwise change the behavior of less on a dumb terminal.]' \
        '(-D --color)'{-D,--color}'[\[MS-DOS only\] Sets the color of the text displayed.  x is a single character which selects  the  type  of  text  whose color  is  being  set: n=normal, s=standout, d=bold, u=underlined, k=blink.  color is a pair of numbers separated by a period.  The first number selects the foreground color and the second selects the background color  of  the  text.   A single  number N is the same as N.M, where M is the normal background color.  The color may start or end with u to use underline (with the normal color, if by itself), if the system supports it (Windows only).  x may also be a to  toggle strict ANSI sequence rendering (SGR mode).]' \
        '(-e --quit-at-eof)'{-e,--quit-at-eof}'[Causes  less  to  automatically exit the second time it reaches end-of-file.  By default, the only way to exit less is via the "q" command.]' \
        '(-E --QUIT-AT-EOF)'{-E,--QUIT-AT-EOF}'[Causes less to automatically exit the first time it reaches end-of-file.]' \
        '(-f --force)'{-f,--force}'[Forces non-regular files to be opened.  (A non-regular file is a directory or a device special file.)  Also suppresses the  warning message when a binary file is opened.  By default, less will refuse to open non-regular files.  Note that some operating systems will not allow directories to be read, even if -f is set.]' \
        '(-F --quit-if-one-screen)'{-F,--quit-if-one-screen}'[Causes less to automatically exit if the entire file can be displayed on the first screen.]' \
        '(-g --hilite-search)'{-g,--hilite-search}'[Normally, less will highlight ALL strings which match the last search command.  The -g option changes this behavior to highlight  only the particular string which was found by the last search command.  This can cause less to run somewhat faster than the default.]' \
        '(-G --HILITE-SEARCH)'{-G,--HILITE-SEARCH}'[The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found by search commands.]' \
        '(-h --max-back-scroll)'{-h,--max-back-scroll}'[Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll backward.  If it is necessary to scroll backward more than n lines,  the screen  is  repainted  in a forward direction instead.  (If the terminal does not have the ability to scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)]' \
        '(-i --ignore-case)'{-i,--ignore-case}'[Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.  This option is ignored  if any uppercase letters appear in the search pattern; in other words, if a pattern contains uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore case.]' \
        '(-I --IGNORE-CASE)'{-I,--IGNORE-CASE}'[Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the pattern contains uppercase letters.]' \
        '(-j --jump-target)'{-j,--jump-target}'[Specifies a line on the screen where the "target" line is to be positioned.  The target line is the line specified  by any  command  to  search for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a file percentage or jump to a tag.  The screen line may be specified by a number: the top line on the screen is 1, the next is 2, and so on.  The number may be negative  to  specify  a line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen is -1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so on.  Alternately, the screen line may be specified as a fraction of the  height  of  the  screen, starting  with a decimal point: .5 is in the middle of the screen, .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and so on.  If the line is specified as a fraction, the actual line number is recalculated if the terminal window is resized, so that the target line remains at the specified fraction of the screen height.  If any form of the -j option is used, repeated forward searches (invoked with "n" or "N") begin at the line immediately after the target line, and  repeated backward  searches  begin  at  the target line, unless changed by -a -A.  For example, if "-j4" is used, the target line is the fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth line on the screen.  However nonrepeated searches (invoked with "/" or "?")  always begin at the start or end of the current screen respectively.]' \
        '(-J --status-column)'{-J,--status-column}'[Displays  a  status column at the left edge of the screen.  The status column shows the lines that matched the current search, and any lines that are marked (via the m or M command).  The status column is also used if the -w -W option is in effect.]' \
        '(-k --lesskey-file)'{-k,--lesskey-file}'[Causes less to open and interpret the named file as a lesskey (1) file.  Multiple -k options may be specified.  If the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or if a lesskey file is found in  a  standard  place  (see  KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a lesskey file.]:file:_files' \
        '(-K --quit-on-intr)'{-K,--quit-on-intr}'[Causes  less  to exit immediately (with status 2) when an interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed.  Normally, an interrupt character causes less to stop whatever it is doing and return to its command prompt.  Note that  use  of  this option makes it impossible to return to the command prompt from the "F" command.]' \
        '(-L --no-lessopen)'{-L,--no-lessopen}'[Ignore  the  LESSOPEN  environment  variable  (see the INPUT PREPROCESSOR section below).  This option can be set from within less, but it will apply only to files opened subsequently, not to the file which is currently open.]' \
        '(-m --long-prompt)'{-m,--long-prompt}'[Causes less to prompt verbosely (like more), with the percent into the file.  By default, less prompts with a colon.]' \
        '(-M --LONG-PROMPT)'{-M,--LONG-PROMPT}'[Causes less to prompt even more verbosely than more.]' \
        '(-n --line-numbers)'{-n,--line-numbers}'[Suppresses line numbers.  The default (to use line numbers) may cause less to run more slowly  in  some  cases,  especially with a very large input file.  Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will avoid this problem.  Using line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in the verbose prompt and in the = command, and the  v  command  will pass the current line number to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).]' \
        '(-N --LINE-NUMBERS)'{-N,--LINE-NUMBERS}'[Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of each line in the display.]' \
        '(-o --log-file)'{-o,--log-file}'[Causes  less  to  copy  its input to the named file as it is being viewed.  This applies only when the input file is a pipe, not an ordinary file.  If the file already exists, less will ask for confirmation before overwriting it.]:file:_files' \
        '(-O --LOG-FILE)'{-O,--LOG-FILE}'[The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing file without asking for confirmation.]:file:_files' \
        '(-p --pattern)'{-p,--pattern}'[The -p option on the command line is equivalent to specifying +/pattern; that is, it tells less to start at the  first occurrence of pattern in the file.]' \
        '(-P --prompt)'{-P,--prompt}'[Provides  a  way  to  tailor the three prompt styles to your own preference.  This option would normally be put in the LESS environment variable, rather than being typed in with each less command.  Such an option must either be the  last option in the LESS variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign.]' \
        '(-q --quiet --silent)'{-q,--quiet,--silent}'[Causes moderately "quiet" operation: the terminal bell is not rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file  or before the beginning of the file.  If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used instead.  The bell will be rung on certain other errors, such as typing an invalid character.  The default is to ring the terminal  bell  in  all such cases.]' \
        '(-Q --QUIET --SILENT)'{-Q,--QUIET,--SILENT}'[Causes totally "quiet" operation: the terminal bell is never rung.  If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used in all cases where the terminal bell would have been rung.]' \
        '(-r --raw-control-chars)'{-r,--raw-control-chars}'[Causes "raw" control characters to be displayed.  The default is to display control characters using the  caret  notation;  for  example,  a  control-A (octal 001) is displayed as "^A".  Warning: when the -r option is used, less cannot keep track of the actual appearance of the screen (since this depends on how the screen responds to each type of  control character).  Thus, various display problems may result, such as long lines being split in the wrong place.]' \
        '(-R --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS)'{-R,--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS}'[Like  -r,  but only ANSI "color" escape sequences are output in "raw" form.  Unlike -r, the screen appearance is maintained correctly in most cases.  ANSI "color" escape sequences are sequences of the form:]' \
        '(-s --squeeze-blank-lines)'{-s,--squeeze-blank-lines}'[Causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a single blank line.  This is useful when viewing nroff output.]' \
        '(-S --chop-long-lines)'{-S,--chop-long-lines}'[Causes  lines  longer  than the screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped.  That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in the screen width is not shown.  The default is to wrap long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.]' \
        '(-t --tag)'{-t,--tag}'[The  -t option, followed immediately by a TAG, will edit the file containing that tag.  For this to work, tag information must be available; for example, there may be a file in the current directory called "tags", which was  previously built by ctags (1) or an equivalent command.  If the environment variable LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it is taken to be the name  of  a  command  compatible  with  global  (1),  and  that  command  is  executed  to   find   the   tag.    (See http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html).   The  -t  option may also be specified from within less (using the command) as a way of examining a new file.  The command ":t" is equivalent to specifying -t from within less.]' \
        '(-T --tag-file)'{-T,--tag-file}'[Specifies a tags file to be used instead of "tags".]:file:_files' \
        '(-u --underline-special)'{-u,--underline-special}'[Causes backspaces and carriage returns to be treated as printable characters; that is, they are sent to  the  terminal when they appear in the input.]' \
        '(-U --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL)'{-U,--UNDERLINE-SPECIAL}'[Causes backspaces, tabs, carriage returns and "formatting characters" (as defined by Unicode) to be treated as control characters; that is, they are handled as specified by the -r option.]' \
        '(-V --version)'{-V,--version}'[Displays the version number of less.]' \
        '(-w --hilite-unread)'{-w,--hilite-unread}'[Temporarily highlights the first "new" line after a forward movement of a full page.  The first "new" line is the line immediately following the line previously at the bottom of the screen.  Also highlights the target line after a g or p command.   The highlight is removed at the next command which causes movement.  The entire line is highlighted, unless the -J option is in effect, in which case only the status column is highlighted.]' \
        '(-W --HILITE-UNREAD)'{-W,--HILITE-UNREAD}'[Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first new line after any forward movement command larger than one line.]' \
        '(-x --tabs)'{-x,--tabs}'[Sets tab stops.  If only one n is specified, tab stops are set at multiples of n.  If  multiple  values  separated  by commas  are  specified, tab stops are set at those positions, and then continue with the same spacing as the last two. For example, -x9,17 will set tabs at positions 9, 17, 25, 33, etc.  The default for n is 8.]' \
        '(-X --no-init)'{-X,--no-init}'[Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.  This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization string does something unnecessary, like clearing the screen.]' \
        '(-y --max-forw-scroll)'{-y,--max-forw-scroll}'[Specifies  a  maximum  number of lines to scroll forward.  If it is necessary to scroll forward more than n lines, the screen is repainted instead.  The -c -C option may be used to repaint from the top of the screen  if  desired.      By default, any forward movement causes scrolling.]' \
        '(-z --window -n)'{-z,--window,-n}'[Changes the default scrolling window size to n lines.  The default is one screenful.  The z and w commands can also be used to change the window size.  The "z" may be omitted for compatibility with some versions of more.  If the number n is  negative,  it  indicates  n lines less than the current screen size.  For example, if the screen is 24 lines, -z-4 sets the scrolling window to 20 lines.  If the screen is resized to  40  lines,  the  scrolling  window  automatically changes to 36 lines.]' \
        '(-" --quotes)'{-",--quotes}'[Changes  the  filename  quoting character.  This may be necessary if you are trying to name a file which contains both spaces and quote characters.  Followed by a single character, this changes the  quote  character  to  that  character. Filenames  containing  a  space should then be surrounded by that character rather than by double quotes.  Followed by two characters, changes the open quote to the first character, and the close quote to the second character.  Filenames containing  a  space  should  then  be preceded by the open quote character and followed by the close quote character. Note that even after the quote characters are changed, this option remains -" (a dash followed by a double quote).]' \
        '(-~ --tilde)'{-~,--tilde}'[Normally lines after end of file are displayed as a single tilde (~).  This option causes lines after end of  file  to be displayed as blank lines.]' \
        '(-# --shift)'{-#,--shift}'[Specifies  the  default  number  of positions to scroll horizontally in the RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands.  If the number specified is zero, it sets the default number of positions to one half of the screen width.   Alternately,  the number  may  be  specified  as a fraction of the width of the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is half of the screen width, .3 is three tenths of the screen width, and so on.  If the number is specified as a fraction, the actual number of scroll positions is recalculated if the terminal window is resized, so that the actual scroll remains at the specified fraction of the screen width.]' \
        '--follow-name[Normally, if the input file is renamed while an F command is executing, less will continue to display the contents  of the  original file despite its name change.  If --follow-name is specified, during an F command less will periodically attempt to reopen the file by name.  If the reopen succeeds and the file is a different file from the original  (which means  that  a new file has been created with the same name as the original (now renamed) file), less will display the contents of that new file.]' \
        '--mouse[Enables mouse input: scrolling the mouse wheel down moves forward in the file, scrolling  the  mouse  wheel  up  moves backwards in the file, and clicking the mouse sets the "#" mark to the line where the mouse is clicked.  The number of lines to scroll when the wheel is moved can be set by the --wheel-lines option.  Mouse input works only  on  terminals which support X11 mouse reporting, and on the Windows version of less.]' \
        '--MOUSE[Like --mouse, except the direction scrolled on mouse wheel movement is reversed.]' \
        '--no-keypad[Disables  sending the keypad initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.  This is sometimes useful if the keypad strings make the numeric keypad behave in an undesirable manner.]' \
        '--no-histdups[This option changes the behavior so that if a search string or file name is typed in, and the same string  is  already in  the  history  list, the existing copy is removed from the history list before the new one is added.  Thus, a given string will appear only once in the history list.  Normally, a string may appear multiple times.]' \
        '--rscroll[This option changes the character used to mark truncated lines.  It may begin with a two-character attribute indicator like  LESSBINFMT  does.  If there is no attribute indicator, standout is used.  If set to "-", truncated lines are not marked.]' \
        '--save-marks[Save marks in the history file, so marks are retained across different invocations of less.]' \
        '--use-backslash[This option changes the interpretations of options which follow this one.  After the --use-backslash option, any backslash  in an option string is removed and the following character is taken literally.  This allows a dollar sign to be included in option strings.]' \
        '--wheel-lines[Set the number of lines to scroll when the mouse wheel is scrolled and the --mouse --MOUSE  option  is     in  effect. The default is 1 line.]' \
        '--[A  command  line  argument of "--" marks the end of option arguments.  Any arguments following this are interpreted as filenames.  This can be useful when viewing a file whose name begins with a "-" or "+".]' \
