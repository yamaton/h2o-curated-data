    _arguments -C \
        '-4[Use IPv4 addresses only.]' \
        '-6[Use IPv6 addresses only.]' \
        '-b[Allow broadcast.]' \
        '-C[Send CRLF as line-ending. Each line feed (LF) character from the input data is translated into CR+LF before being written to the socket. Line feed characters that are already preceded with a carriage return (CR) are not translated. Received data is not affected.]' \
        '-D[Enable debugging on the socket.]' \
        '-d[Do not attempt to read from stdin.]' \
        '-F[Pass the first connected socket using sendmsg(2) to stdout and exit. This is useful in conjunction with -X to have nc perform connection setup with a proxy but then leave the rest of the connection to another program (e.g. ssh(1) using the ssh_config(5) ProxyUseFdpass option). Cannot be used with -U.]' \
        '-h[Print out the nc help text and exit.]' \
        '-I[Specify the size of the TCP receive buffer.]' \
        '-i[Sleep for interval seconds between lines of text sent and received. Also causes a delay time between connections to multiple ports.]' \
        '-k[When a connection is completed, listen for another one. Requires -l. When used together with the -u option, the server socket is not connected and it can receive UDP datagrams from multiple hosts.]' \
        '-l[Listen for an incoming connection rather than initiating a connection to a remote host. The destination and port to listen on can be specified either as non-optional arguments, or with options -s and -p respectively. Cannot be used together with -x or -z. Additionally, any timeouts specified with the -w option are ignored.]' \
        '-M[Set the TTL / hop limit of outgoing packets.]' \
        '-m[Ask the kernel to drop incoming packets whose TTL / hop limit is under minttl.]' \
        '-N[shutdown(2) the network socket after EOF on the input. Some servers require this to finish their work.]' \
        '-n[Do not perform domain name resolution. If a name cannot be resolved without DNS, an error will be reported.]' \
        '-O[Specify the size of the TCP send buffer.]' \
        '-P[Specifies a username to present to a proxy server that requires authentication. If no username is specified then authentication will not be attempted. Proxy authentication is only supported for HTTP CONNECT proxies at present.]' \
        '-p[Specify the source port nc should use, subject to privilege restrictions and availability.]' \
        '-q[after EOF on stdin, wait the specified number of seconds and then quit. If seconds is negative, wait forever (default). Specifying a non-negative seconds implies -N.]' \
        '-r[Choose source and/or destination ports randomly instead of sequentially within a range or in the order that the system assigns them.]' \
        '-S[Enable the RFC 2385 TCP MD5 signature option.]' \
        '-s[Set the source address to send packets from, which is useful on machines with multiple interfaces. For UNIX-domain datagram sockets, specifies the local temporary socket file to create and use so that datagrams can be received. Cannot be used together with -x.]' \
        '-T[Change the IPv4 TOS/IPv6 traffic class value. keyword may be one of critical, inetcontrol, lowcost, lowdelay, netcontrol, throughput, reliability, or one of the DiffServ Code Points: ef, af11 ... af43, cs0 ... cs7; or a number in either hex or decimal.]' \
        '-t[Send RFC 854 DON'\''T and WON'\''T responses to RFC 854 DO and WILL requests. This makes it possible to use nc to script telnet sessions.]' \
        '-U[Use UNIX-domain sockets. Cannot be used together with -F or -x.]' \
        '-u[Use UDP instead of TCP. Cannot be used together with -x. For UNIX-domain sockets, use a datagram socket instead of a stream socket. If a UNIX-domain socket is used, a temporary receiving socket is created in /tmp unless the -s flag is given.]' \
        '-V[Set the routing table to be used.]' \
        '-v[Produce more verbose output.]' \
        '-W[Terminate after receiving recvlimit packets from the network.]' \
        '-w[Connections which cannot be established or are idle timeout after timeout seconds. The -w flag has no effect on the -l option, i.e. nc will listen forever for a connection, with or without the -w flag. The default is no timeout.]' \
        '-X[Use proxy_protocol when talking to the proxy server. Supported protocols are 4 (SOCKS v.4), 5 (SOCKS v.5) and connect (HTTPS proxy). If the protocol is not specified, SOCKS version 5 is used.]' \
        '-x[Connect to destination using a proxy at proxy_address and port. If port is not specified, the well-known port for the proxy protocol is used (1080 for SOCKS, 3128 for HTTPS). An IPv6 address can be specified unambiguously by enclosing proxy_address in square brackets. A proxy cannot be used with any of the options -lsuU.]' \
        '-Z[DCCP mode.]' \
        '-z[Only scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them. Cannot be used together with -l.]' \
