        {-f,-r,--from,--read}'[Specify input format.]' \
        {-t,-w,--to,--write}'[Specify output format.]' \
        {-o,--output}'[Write output to FILE instead of stdout. If FILE is -, output will go to stdout, even if a non-textual format (docx, odt, epub2, epub3) is specified.]':file:_files \
        '--data-dir[Specify the user data directory to search for pandoc data files. If this option is not specified, the default user data directory will be used. On *nix and macOS systems this will be the pandoc subdirectory of the XDG data directory (by default, $HOME/.local/share, overridable by setting the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable). If that directory does not exist and $HOME/.pandoc exists, it will be used (for backwards compatibility). On Windows the default user data directory is C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\pandoc. You can find the default user data directory on your system by looking at the output of pandoc --version. Data files placed in this directory (for example, reference.odt, reference.docx, epub.css, templates) will override pandoc’s normal defaults.]':file:_files \
        {-d,--defaults}'[Specify a set of default option settings. FILE is a YAML file whose fields correspond to command-line option settings. All options for document conversion, including input and output files, can be set using a defaults file. The file will be searched for first in the working directory, and then in the defaults subdirectory of the user data directory (see --data-dir). The .yaml extension may be omitted. See the section Defaults files for more information on the file format. Settings from the defaults file may be overridden or extended by subsequent options on the command line.]':file:_files \
        '--bash-completion[Generate a bash completion script. To enable bash completion with pandoc, add this to your .bashrc: eval "$(pandoc --bash-completion)"]' \
        '--verbose[Give verbose debugging output.]' \
        '--quiet[Suppress warning messages.]' \
        '--fail-if-warnings[Exit with error status if there are any warnings.]' \
        '--log[Write log messages in machine-readable JSON format to FILE. All messages above DEBUG level will be written, regardless of verbosity settings (--verbose, --quiet).]':file:_files \
        '--list-input-formats[List supported input formats, one per line.]' \
        '--list-output-formats[List supported output formats, one per line.]' \
        '--list-extensions[List supported extensions for FORMAT, one per line, preceded by a + or - indicating whether it is enabled by default in FORMAT. If FORMAT is not specified, defaults for pandoc’s Markdown are given.]' \
        '--list-highlight-languages[List supported languages for syntax highlighting, one per line.]' \
        '--list-highlight-styles[List supported styles for syntax highlighting, one per line. See --highlight-style.]' \
        {-v,--version}'[Print version.]' \
        {-h,--help}'[Show usage message.]' \
        '--shift-heading-level-by[Shift heading levels by a positive or negative integer. For example, with --shift-heading-level-by=-1, level 2 headings become level 1 headings, and level 3 headings become level 2 headings. Headings cannot have a level less than 1, so a heading that would be shifted below level 1 becomes a regular paragraph. Exception: with a shift of -N, a level-N heading at the beginning of the document replaces the metadata title. --shift-heading-level-by=-1 is a good choice when converting HTML or Markdown documents that use an initial level-1 heading for the document title and level-2+ headings for sections. --shift-heading-level-by=1 may be a good choice for converting Markdown documents that use level-1 headings for sections to HTML, since pandoc uses a level-1 heading to render the document title.]' \
        '--base-header-level[Deprecated. Use --shift-heading-level-by=X instead, where X = NUMBER - 1. Specify the base level for headings (defaults to 1).]' \
        '--indented-code-classes[Specify classes to use for indented code blocks–for example, perl,numberLines or haskell. Multiple classes may be separated by spaces or commas.]' \
        '--default-image-extension[Specify a default extension to use when image paths/URLs have no extension. This allows you to use the same source for formats that require different kinds of images. Currently this option only affects the Markdown and LaTeX readers.]' \
        '--file-scope[Parse each file individually before combining for multifile documents. This will allow footnotes in different files with the same identifiers to work as expected. If this option is set, footnotes and links will not work across files. Reading binary files (docx, odt, epub) implies --file-scope.]' \
        {-F,--filter}'[Specify an executable to be used as a filter transforming the pandoc AST after the input is parsed and before the output is written. The executable should read JSON from stdin and write JSON to stdout. The JSON must be formatted like pandoc’s own JSON input and output. The name of the output format will be passed to the filter as the first argument.]' \
        {-L,--lua-filter}'[Transform the document in a similar fashion as JSON filters (see --filter), but use pandoc’s built-in Lua filtering system. The given Lua script is expected to return a list of Lua filters which will be applied in order. Each Lua filter must contain element-transforming functions indexed by the name of the AST element on which the filter function should be applied.]' \
        {-M,--metadata}'[Set the metadata field KEY to the value VAL. A value specified on the command line overrides a value specified in the document using YAML metadata blocks. Values will be parsed as YAML boolean or string values. If no value is specified, the value will be treated as Boolean true. Like --variable, --metadata causes template variables to be set. But unlike --variable, --metadata affects the metadata of the underlying document (which is accessible from filters and may be printed in some output formats) and metadata values will be escaped when inserted into the template.]' \
        '--metadata-file[Read metadata from the supplied YAML (or JSON) file. This option can be used with every input format, but string scalars in the YAML file will always be parsed as Markdown. (If the input format is Markdown or a Markdown variant, then the same variant will be used to parse the metadata file; if it is a non-Markdown format, pandoc’s default Markdown extensions will be used.) This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple metadata files; values in files specified later on the command line will be preferred over those specified in earlier files. Metadata values specified inside the document, or by using -M, overwrite values specified with this option. The file will be searched for first in the working directory, and then in the metadata subdirectory of the user data directory (see --data-dir).]':file:_files \
        {-p,--preserve-tabs}'[Preserve tabs instead of converting them to spaces. (By default, pandoc converts tabs to spaces before parsing its input.) Note that this will only affect tabs in literal code spans and code blocks. Tabs in regular text are always treated as spaces.]' \
        '--tab-stop[Specify the number of spaces per tab (default is 4).]' \
        '--track-changes[Specifies what to do with insertions, deletions, and comments produced by the MS Word “Track Changes” feature. accept (the default) processes all the insertions and deletions. reject ignores them. Both accept and reject ignore comments. all includes all insertions, deletions, and comments, wrapped in spans with insertion, deletion, comment-start, and comment-end classes, respectively. The author and time of change is included. all is useful for scripting: only accepting changes from a certain reviewer, say, or before a certain date. If a paragraph is inserted or deleted, track-changes=all produces a span with the class paragraph-insertion/paragraph-deletion before the affected paragraph break. This option only affects the docx reader.]' \
        '--extract-media[Extract images and other media contained in or linked from the source document to the path DIR, creating it if necessary, and adjust the images references in the document so they point to the extracted files. Media are downloaded, read from the file system, or extracted from a binary container (e.g. docx), as needed. The original file paths are used if they are relative paths not containing ... Otherwise filenames are constructed from the SHA1 hash of the contents.]':file:_files \
        '--abbreviations[Specifies a custom abbreviations file, with abbreviations one to a line. If this option is not specified, pandoc will read the data file abbreviations from the user data directory or fall back on a system default. To see the system default, use pandoc --print-default-data-file=abbreviations. The only use pandoc makes of this list is in the Markdown reader. Strings found in this list will be followed by a nonbreaking space, and the period will not produce sentence-ending space in formats like LaTeX. The strings may not contain spaces.]':file:_files \
        '--trace[Print diagnostic output tracing parser progress to stderr. This option is intended for use by developers in diagnosing performance issues.]' \
        {-s,--standalone}'[Produce output with an appropriate header and footer (e.g. a standalone HTML, LaTeX, TEI, or RTF file, not a fragment). This option is set automatically for pdf, epub, epub3, fb2, docx, and odt output. For native output, this option causes metadata to be included; otherwise, metadata is suppressed.]' \
        '--template[Use the specified file as a custom template for the generated document. Implies --standalone. See Templates, below, for a description of template syntax. If no extension is specified, an extension corresponding to the writer will be added, so that --template=special looks for special.html for HTML output. If the template is not found, pandoc will search for it in the templates subdirectory of the user data directory (see --data-dir). If this option is not used, a default template appropriate for the output format will be used (see -D/--print-default-template).]':file:_files \
        {-V,--variable}'[Set the template variable KEY to the value VAL when rendering the document in standalone mode. If no VAL is specified, the key will be given the value true.]' \
        '--sandbox[Run pandoc in a sandbox, limiting IO operations in readers and writers to reading the files specified on the command line. Note that this option does not limit IO operations by filters or in the production of PDF documents. But it does offer security against, for example, disclosure of files through the use of include directives. Anyone using pandoc on untrusted user input should use this option.]' \
        {-D,--print-default-template}'[Print the system default template for an output FORMAT. (See -t for a list of possible FORMATs.) Templates in the user data directory are ignored. This option may be used with -o/--output to redirect output to a file, but -o/--output must come before --print-default-template on the command line.]' \
        '--print-default-data-file[Print a system default data file. Files in the user data directory are ignored. This option may be used with -o/--output to redirect output to a file, but -o/--output must come before --print-defaultdata-file on the command line.]':file:_files \
        '--eol[Manually specify line endings: crlf (Windows), lf (macOS/Linux/UNIX), or native (line endings appropriate to the OS on which pandoc is being run). The default is native.]' \
        '--dpi[Specify the default dpi (dots per inch) value for conversion from pixels to inch/centimeters and vice versa. (Technically, the correct term would be ppi: pixels per inch.) The default is 96dpi. When images contain information about dpi internally, the encoded value is used instead of the default specified by this option.]' \
        '--wrap[Determine how text is wrapped in the output (the source code, not the rendered version). With auto (the default), pandoc will attempt to wrap lines to the column width specified by --columns (default 72). With none, pandoc will not wrap lines at all. With preserve, pandoc will attempt to preserve the wrapping from the source document (that is, where there are nonsemantic newlines in the source, there will be nonsemantic newlines in the output as well). In ipynb output, this option affects wrapping of the contents of markdown cells.]' \
        '--columns[Specify length of lines in characters. This affects text wrapping in the generated source code (see --wrap). It also affects calculation of column widths for plain text tables (see Tables below).]' \
        {--toc,--table-of-contents}'[Include an automatically generated table of contents (or, in the case of latex, context, docx, odt, opendocument, rst, or ms, an instruction to create one) in the output document. This option has no effect unless -s/--standalone is used, and it has no effect on man, docbook4, docbook5, or jats output.]' \
        '--toc-depth[Specify the number of section levels to include in the table of contents. The default is 3 (which means that level-1, 2, and 3 headings will be listed in the contents).]' \
        '--strip-comments[Strip out HTML comments in the Markdown or Textile source, rather than passing them on to Markdown, Textile or HTML output as raw HTML. This does not apply to HTML comments inside raw HTML blocks when the markdown_in_html_blocks extension is not set.]' \
        '--no-highlight[Disables syntax highlighting for code blocks and inlines, even when a language attribute is given.]' \
        '--highlight-style[Specifies the coloring style to be used in highlighted source code. Options are pygments (the default), kate, monochrome, breezeDark, espresso, zenburn, haddock, and tango. For more information on syntax highlighting in pandoc, see Syntax highlighting, below. See also --list-highlight-styles.]':file:_files \
        '--print-highlight-style[Prints a JSON version of a highlighting style, which can be modified, saved with a .theme extension, and used with --highlight-style. This option may be used with -o/--output to redirect output to a file, but -o/--output must come before --print-highlight-style on the command line.]':file:_files \
        '--syntax-definition[Instructs pandoc to load a KDE XML syntax definition file, which will be used for syntax highlighting of appropriately marked code blocks. This can be used to add support for new languages or to use altered syntax definitions for existing languages. This option may be repeated to add multiple syntax definitions.]':file:_files \
        {-H,--include-in-header}'[Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the header. This can be used, for example, to include special CSS or JavaScript in HTML documents. This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files in the header. They will be included in the order specified. Implies --standalone.]':file:_files \
        {-B,--include-before-body}'[Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the beginning of the document body (e.g. after the <body> tag in HTML, or the \begin{document} command in LaTeX). This can be used to include navigation bars or banners in HTML documents. This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files. They will be included in the order specified. Implies --standalone.]':file:_files \
        {-A,--include-after-body}'[Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the document body (before the </body> tag in HTML, or the \end{document} command in LaTeX). This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files. They will be included in the order specified. Implies --standalone.]':file:_files \
        '--resource-path[List of paths to search for images and other resources. The paths should be separated by : on Linux, UNIX, and macOS systems, and by ; on Windows. If --resource-path is not specified, the default resource path is the working directory. Note that, if --resource-path is specified, the working directory must be explicitly listed or it will not be searched. For example: --resource-path=.:test will search the working directory and the test subdirectory, in that order. This option can be used repeatedly. Search path components that come later on the command line will be searched before those that come earlier, so --resource-path foo:bar --resource-path baz:bim is equivalent to --resource-path baz:bim:foo:bar.]':file:_files \
        '--request-header[Set the request header NAME to the value VAL when making HTTP requests (for example, when a URL is given on the command line, or when resources used in a document must be downloaded). If you’re behind a proxy, you also need to set the environment variable http_proxy to http://....]' \
        '--no-check-certificate[Disable the certificate verification to allow access to unsecure HTTP resources (for example when the certificate is no longer valid or self signed).]' \
        '--self-contained[Deprecated synonym for --embed-resources --standalone.]' \
        '--embed-resources[Produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. The resulting file should be “self-contained,” in the sense that it needs no external files and no net access to be displayed properly by a browser. This option works only with HTML output formats, including html4, html5, html+lhs, html5+lhs, s5, slidy, slideous, dzslides, and revealjs. Scripts, images, and stylesheets at absolute URLs will be downloaded; those at relative URLs will be sought relative to the working directory (if the first source file is local) or relative to the base URL (if the first source file is remote). Elements with the attribute data-external="1" will be left alone; the documents they link to will not be incorporated in the document. Limitation: resources that are loaded dynamically through JavaScript cannot be incorporated; as a result, some advanced features (e.g. zoom or speaker notes) may not work in an offline “self-contained” reveal.js slide show.]' \
        '--html-q-tags[Use <q> tags for quotes in HTML. (This option only has an effect if the smart extension is enabled for the input format used.)]' \
        '--ascii[Use only ASCII characters in output. Currently supported for XML and HTML formats (which use entities instead of UTF-8 when this option is selected), CommonMark, gfm, and Markdown (which use entities), roff ms (which use hexadecimal escapes), and to a limited degree LaTeX (which uses standard commands for accented characters when possible). roff man output uses ASCII by default.]' \
        '--reference-links[Use reference-style links, rather than inline links, in writing Markdown or reStructuredText. By default inline links are used. The placement of link references is affected by the --reference-location option.]' \
        '--reference-location[Specify whether footnotes (and references, if reference-links is set) are placed at the end of the current (top-level) block, the current section, or the document. The default is document. Currently this option only affects the markdown, muse, html, epub, slidy, s5, slideous, dzslides, and revealjs writers.]' \
        '--markdown-headings[Specify whether to use ATX-style (#-prefixed) or Setext-style (underlined) headings for level 1 and 2 headings in Markdown output. (The default is atx.) ATX-style headings are always used for levels 3+. This option also affects Markdown cells in ipynb output.]' \
        '--list-tables[Render tables as list tables in RST output.]' \
        '--top-level-division[Treat top-level headings as the given division type in LaTeX, ConTeXt, DocBook, and TEI output. The hierarchy order is part, chapter, then section; all headings are shifted such that the top-level heading becomes the specified type. The default behavior is to determine the best division type via heuristics: unless other conditions apply, section is chosen. When the documentclass variable is set to report, book, or memoir (unless the article option is specified), chapter is implied as the setting for this option. If beamer is the output format, specifying either chapter or part will cause top-level headings to become \part{..}, while second-level headings remain as their default type.]' \
        {-N,--number-sections}'[Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML, Docx, ms, or EPUB output. By default, sections are not numbered. Sections with class unnumbered will never be numbered, even if --number-sections is specified.]' \
        '--number-offset[Offset for section headings in HTML output (ignored in other output formats). The first number is added to the section number for top-level headings, the second for second-level headings, and so on. So, for example, if you want the first top-level heading in your document to be numbered “6”, specify --number-offset=5. If your document starts with a level-2 heading which you want to be numbered “1.5”, specify --number-offset=1,4. Offsets are 0 by default. Implies --number-sections.]' \
        '--listings[Use the listings package for LaTeX code blocks. The package does not support multi-byte encoding for source code. To handle UTF-8 you would need to use a custom template. This issue is fully documented here: Encoding issue with the listings package.]' \
        {-i,--incremental}'[Make list items in slide shows display incrementally (one by one). The default is for lists to be displayed all at once.]' \
        '--slide-level[Specifies that headings with the specified level create slides (for beamer, s5, slidy, slideous, dzslides). Headings above this level in the hierarchy are used to divide the slide show into sections; headings below this level create subheads within a slide. Valid values are 0-6. If a slide level of 0 is specified, slides will not be split automatically on headings, and horizontal rules must be used to indicate slide boundaries. If a slide level is not specified explicitly, the slide level will be set automatically based on the contents of the document; see Structuring the slide show.]' \
        '--section-divs[Wrap sections in <section> tags (or <div> tags for html4), and attach identifiers to the enclosing <section> (or <div>) rather than the heading itself. See Heading identifiers, below.]' \
        '--email-obfuscation[Specify a method for obfuscating mailto: links in HTML documents. none leaves mailto: links as they are. javascript obfuscates them using JavaScript. references obfuscates them by printing their letters as decimal or hexadecimal character references. The default is none.]' \
        '--id-prefix[Specify a prefix to be added to all identifiers and internal links in HTML and DocBook output, and to footnote numbers in Markdown and Haddock output. This is useful for preventing duplicate identifiers when generating fragments to be included in other pages.]' \
        {-T,--title-prefix}'[Specify STRING as a prefix at the beginning of the title that appears in the HTML header (but not in the title as it appears at the beginning of the HTML body). Implies --standalone.]' \
        {-c,--css}'[Link to a CSS style sheet. This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files. They will be included in the order specified.]' \
        '--reference-doc[Use the specified file as a style reference in producing a docx or ODT file.]':file:_files \
        '--epub-cover-image[Use the specified image as the EPUB cover. It is recommended that the image be less than 1000px in width and height. Note that in a Markdown source document you can also specify cover-image in a YAML metadata block (see EPUB Metadata, below).]':file:_files \
        '--epub-metadata[Look in the specified XML file for metadata for the EPUB. The file should contain a series of Dublin Core elements.]':file:_files \
        '--epub-embed-font[Embed the specified font in the EPUB. This option can be repeated to embed multiple fonts. Wildcards can also be used: for example, DejaVuSans-*.ttf. However, if you use wildcards on the command line, be sure to escape them or put the whole filename in single quotes, to prevent them from being interpreted by the shell.]':file:_files \
        '--epub-chapter-level[Specify the heading level at which to split the EPUB into separate “chapter” files. The default is to split into chapters at level-1 headings. This option only affects the internal composition of the EPUB, not the way chapters and sections are displayed to users. Some readers may be slow if the chapter files are too large, so for large documents with few level-1 headings, one might want to use a chapter level of 2 or 3.]' \
        '--epub-subdirectory[Specify the subdirectory in the OCF container that is to hold the EPUB-specific contents. The default is EPUB. To put the EPUB contents in the top level, use an empty string.]':file:_files \
        '--ipynb-output[Determines how ipynb output cells are treated. all means that all of the data formats included in the original are preserved. none means that the contents of data cells are omitted. best causes pandoc to try to pick the richest data block in each output cell that is compatible with the output format. The default is best.]' \
        '--pdf-engine[Use the specified engine when producing PDF output. Valid values are pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, latexmk, tectonic, wkhtmltopdf, weasyprint, pagedjs-cli, prince, context, and pdfroff. If the engine is not in your PATH, the full path of the engine may be specified here. If this option is not specified, pandoc uses the following defaults depending on the output format specified using -t/--to.]' \
        '--pdf-engine-opt[Use the given string as a command-line argument to the pdf-engine. For example, to use a persistent directory foo for latexmk’s auxiliary files, use --pdf-engine-opt=-outdir=foo. Note that no check for duplicate options is done.]' \
        {-C,--citeproc}'[Process the citations in the file, replacing them with rendered citations and adding a bibliography. Citation processing will not take place unless bibliographic data is supplied, either through an external file specified using the --bibliography option or the bibliography field in metadata, or via a references section in metadata containing a list of citations in CSL YAML format with Markdown formatting. The style is controlled by a CSL stylesheet specified using the --csl option or the csl field in metadata. (If no stylesheet is specified, the chicago-author-date style will be used by default.) The citation processing transformation may be applied before or after filters or Lua filters (see --filter, --lua-filter): these transformations are applied in the order they appear on the command line. For more information, see the section on Citations.]' \
        '--bibliography[Set the bibliography field in the document’s metadata to FILE, overriding any value set in the metadata. If you supply this argument multiple times, each FILE will be added to bibliography. If FILE is a URL, it will be fetched via HTTP. If FILE is not found relative to the working directory, it will be sought in the resource path (see --resource-path).]':file:_files \
        '--csl[Set the csl field in the document’s metadata to FILE, overriding any value set in the metadata. (This is equivalent to --metadata csl=FILE.) If FILE is a URL, it will be fetched via HTTP. If FILE is not found relative to the working directory, it will be sought in the resource path (see --resource-path) and finally in the csl subdirectory of the pandoc user data directory.]':file:_files \
        '--citation-abbreviations[Set the citation-abbreviations field in the document’s metadata to FILE, overriding any value set in the metadata. (This is equivalent to --metadata citation-abbreviations=FILE.) If FILE is a URL, it will be fetched via HTTP. If FILE is not found relative to the working directory, it will be sought in the resource path (see --resource-path) and finally in the csl subdirectory of the pandoc user data directory.]':file:_files \
        '--natbib[Use natbib for citations in LaTeX output. This option is not for use with the --citeproc option or with PDF output. It is intended for use in producing a LaTeX file that can be processed with bibtex.]' \
        '--biblatex[Use biblatex for citations in LaTeX output. This option is not for use with the --citeproc option or with PDF output. It is intended for use in producing a LaTeX file that can be processed with bibtex or biber.]' \
        '--mathjax[Use MathJax to display embedded TeX math in HTML output. TeX math will be put between \(...\) (for inline math) or \\[...\\] (for display math) and wrapped in <span> tags with class math. Then the MathJax JavaScript will render it. The URL should point to the MathJax.js load script. If a URL is not provided, a link to the Cloudflare CDN will be inserted.]' \
        '--mathml[Convert TeX math to MathML (in epub3, docbook4, docbook5, jats, html4 and html5). This is the default in odt output. Note that currently only Firefox and Safari (and select e-book readers) natively support MathML.]' \
        '--webtex[Convert TeX formulas to <img> tags that link to an external script that converts formulas to images. The formula will be URL-encoded and concatenated with the URL provided. For SVG images you can for example use --webtex https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?. If no URL is specified, the CodeCogs URL generating PNGs will be used (https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?). Note: the --webtex option will affect Markdown output as well as HTML, which is useful if you’re targeting a version of Markdown without native math support.]' \
        '--katex[Use KaTeX to display embedded TeX math in HTML output. The URL is the base URL for the KaTeX library. That directory should contain a katex.min.js and a katex.min.css file. If a URL is not provided, a link to the KaTeX CDN will be inserted.]' \
        '--gladtex[Enclose TeX math in <eq> tags in HTML output. The resulting HTML can then be processed by GladTeX to produce SVG images of the typeset formulas and an HTML file with these images embedded.]' \
        '--dump-args[Print information about command-line arguments to stdout, then exit. This option is intended primarily for use in wrapper scripts. The first line of output contains the name of the output file specified with the -o option, or - (for stdout) if no output file was specified. The remaining lines contain the command-line arguments, one per line, in the order they appear. These do not include regular pandoc options and their arguments, but do include any options appearing after a -- separator at the end of the line.]' \
