    _arguments -C \
        {-A,--after-context}'[Show NUM lines after each match.]' \
        '--auto-hybrid-regex[DEPRECATED. Use --engine instead.]' \
        {-B,--before-context}'[Show NUM lines before each match.]' \
        '--binary[Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to search binary files. By default, ripgrep attempts to automatically skip binary files in order to improve the relevance of results and make the search faster.]' \
        '--block-buffered[When enabled, ripgrep will use block buffering. That is, whenever a matching line is found, it will be written to an in-memory buffer and will not be written to stdout until the buffer reaches a certain size. This is the default when ripgrep'\''s stdout is redirected to a pipeline or a file. When ripgrep'\''s stdout is connected to a terminal, line buffering will be used. Forcing block buffering can be useful when dumping a large amount of contents to a terminal.]' \
        {-b,--byte-offset}'[Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each line of output. If -o (--only-matching) is specified, print the offset of the matching part itself.]' \
        {-s,--case-sensitive}'[Search case sensitively.]' \
        '--color[This flag controls when to use colors. The default setting is '\''auto'\'', which means ripgrep will try to guess when to use colors. For example, if ripgrep is printing to a terminal, then it will use colors, but if it is redirected to a file or a pipe, then it will suppress color output. ripgrep will suppress color output in some other circumstances as well. For example, if the TERM environment variable is not set or set to '\''dumb'\'', then ripgrep will not use colors.]' \
        '--colors[This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may be provided multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively. Colors are limited to one of eight choices: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black. Styles are limited to nobold, bold, nointense, intense, nounderline or underline.]' \
        '--column[Show column numbers (1-based). This only shows the column numbers for the first match on each line. This does not try to account for Unicode. One byte is equal to one column. This implies --line-number.]' \
        {-C,--context}'[Show NUM lines before and after each match. This is equivalent to providing both the -B/--before-context and -A/--after-context flags with the same value.]' \
        '--context-separator[The string used to separate non-contiguous context lines in the output. This is only used when one of the context flags is used (-A, -B or -C). Escape sequences like \x7F or \t may be used. The default value is --.]' \
        {-c,--count}'[This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of lines that match the given patterns for each file searched. Each file containing a match has its path and count printed on each line. Note that this reports the number of lines that match and not the total number of matches, unless -U/--multiline is enabled. In multiline mode, --count is equivalent to --count-matches.]' \
        '--count-matches[This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of individual matches of the given patterns for each file searched. Each file containing matches has its path and match count printed on each line. Note that this reports the total number of individual matches and not the number of lines that match.]' \
        '--crlf[When enabled, ripgrep will treat CRLF ('\''\r\n'\'') as a line terminator instead of just '\''\n'\''.]' \
        '--debug[Show debug messages. Please use this when filing a bug report.]' \
        '--dfa-size-limit[The upper size limit of the regex DFA. The default limit is 10M. This should only be changed on very large regex inputs where the (slower) fallback regex engine may otherwise be used if the limit is reached.]' \
        {-E,--encoding}'[Specify the text encoding that ripgrep will use on all files searched. The default value is '\''auto'\'', which will cause ripgrep to do a best effort automatic detection of encoding on a per-file basis. Automatic detection in this case only applies to files that begin with a UTF-8 or UTF-16 byte-order mark (BOM). No other automatic detection is performed. One can also specify '\''none'\'' which will then completely disable BOM sniffing and always result in searching the raw bytes, including a BOM if it'\''s present, regardless of its encoding.]' \
        '--engine[Specify which regular expression engine to use. When you choose a regex engine, it applies that choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e.g., via multiple -e/--regexp or -f/--file flags).]' \
        '--field-context-separator[Set the field context separator, which is used to delimit file paths, line numbers, columns and the context itself, when printing contextual lines. The separator may be any number of bytes, including zero. Escape sequences like \x7F or \t may be used. The default value is -.]' \
        '--field-match-separator[Set the field match separator, which is used to delimit file paths, line numbers, columns and the match itself. The separator may be any number of bytes, including zero. Escape sequences like \x7F or \t may be used. The default value is -.]' \
        {-f,--file}'[Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line. When this flag is used multiple times or in combination with the -e/--regexp flag, then all patterns provided are searched. Empty pattern lines will match all input lines, and the newline is not counted as part of the pattern.]':file:_files \
        '--files[Print each file that would be searched without actually performing the search. This is useful to determine whether a particular file is being searched or not.]' \
        {-l,--files-with-matches}'[Print the paths with at least one match and suppress match contents.]' \
        '--files-without-match[Print the paths that contain zero matches and suppress match contents. This inverts/negates the --files-with-matches flag.]' \
        {-F,--fixed-strings}'[Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. When this flag is used, special regular expression meta characters such as .(){}*+ do not need to be escaped.]' \
        {-L,--follow}'[When this flag is enabled, ripgrep will follow symbolic links while traversing directories. This is disabled by default. Note that ripgrep will check for symbolic link loops and report errors if it finds one.]' \
        {-g,--glob}'[Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence.]' \
        '--glob-case-insensitive[Process glob patterns given with the -g/--glob flag case insensitively. This effectively treats --glob as --iglob.]' \
        {-h,--help}'[Prints help information. Use --help for more details.]' \
        '--heading[This flag prints the file path above clusters of matches from each file instead of printing the file path as a prefix for each matched line. This is the default mode when printing to a terminal.]' \
        {-.,--hidden}'[Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn'\''t provided.]' \
        '--iglob[Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it. Globs are matched case insensitively.]' \
        {-i,--ignore-case}'[When this flag is provided, the given patterns will be searched case insensitively. The case insensitivity rules used by ripgrep conform to Unicode'\''s "simple" case folding rules.]' \
        '--ignore-file[Specifies a path to one or more .gitignore format rules files. These patterns are applied after the patterns found in .gitignore and .ignore are applied and are matched relative to the current working directory. Multiple additional ignore files can be specified by using the --ignore-file flag several times. When specifying multiple ignore files, earlier files have lower precedence than later files.]':file:_files \
        '--ignore-file-case-insensitive[Process ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) case insensitively. Note that this comes with a performance penalty and is most useful on case insensitive file systems (such as Windows).]' \
        '--include-zero[When used with --count or --count-matches, print the number of matches for each file even if there were zero matches. This is disabled by default but can be enabled to make ripgrep behave more like grep.]' \
        {-v,--invert-match}'[Invert matching. Show lines that do not match the given patterns.]' \
        '--json[Enable printing results in a JSON Lines format.]' \
        '--line-buffered[When enabled, ripgrep will use line buffering. That is, whenever a matching line is found, it will be flushed to stdout immediately. This is the default when ripgrep'\''s stdout is connected to a terminal, but otherwise, ripgrep will use block buffering, which is typically faster. This flag forces ripgrep to use line buffering even if it would otherwise use block buffering. This is typically useful in shell pipelines, e.g., '\''tail -f something.log | rg foo --line-buffered | rg bar'\''.]' \
        {-n,--line-number}'[Show line numbers (1-based). This is enabled by default when searching in a terminal.]' \
        {-x,--line-regexp}'[Only show matches surrounded by line boundaries. This is equivalent to putting ^...$ around all of the search patterns. In other words, this only prints lines where the entire line participates in a match.]' \
        {-M,--max-columns}'[Don'\''t print lines longer than this limit in bytes. Longer lines are omitted, and only the number of matches in that line is printed.]' \
        '--max-columns-preview[When the '\''--max-columns'\'' flag is used, ripgrep will by default completely replace any line that is too long with a message indicating that a matching line was removed. When this flag is combined with '\''--max-columns'\'', a preview of the line (corresponding to the limit size) is shown instead, where the part of the line exceeding the limit is not shown.]' \
        {-m,--max-count}'[Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.]' \
        '--max-depth[Limit the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond the paths given. A value of zero only searches the explicitly given paths themselves.]' \
        '--max-filesize[Ignore files larger than NUM in size. This does not apply to directories.]' \
        '--mmap[Search using memory maps when possible. This is enabled by default when ripgrep thinks it will be faster.]' \
        {-U,--multiline}'[Enable matching across multiple lines.]' \
        '--multiline-dotall[This flag enables "dot all" in your regex pattern, which causes '\''.'\'' to match newlines when multiline searching is enabled. This flag has no effect if multiline searching isn'\''t enabled with the --multiline flag.]' \
        '--no-config[Never read configuration files. When this flag is present, ripgrep will not respect the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.]' \
        {-I,--no-filename}'[Never print the file path with the matched lines. This is the default when ripgrep is explicitly instructed to search one file or stdin.]' \
        '--no-heading[Don'\''t group matches by each file. If --no-heading is provided in addition to the -H/--with-filename flag, then file paths will be printed as a prefix for every matched line. This is the default mode when not printing to a terminal.]' \
        '--no-ignore[Don'\''t respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.). This implies --no-ignore-dot, --no-ignore-exclude, --no-ignore-global, no-ignore-parent and --no-ignore-vcs.]' \
        '--no-ignore-dot[Don'\''t respect .ignore files.]' \
        '--no-ignore-exclude[Don'\''t respect ignore files that are manually configured for the repository such as git'\''s '\''.git/info/exclude'\''.]' \
        '--no-ignore-files[When set, any --ignore-file flags, even ones that come after this flag, are ignored.]' \
        '--no-ignore-global[Don'\''t respect ignore files that come from "global" sources such as git'\''s `core.excludesFile` configuration option (which defaults to `$HOME/.config/git/ignore`).]' \
        '--no-ignore-messages[Suppresses all error messages related to parsing ignore files such as .ignore or .gitignore.]' \
        '--no-ignore-parent[Don'\''t respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) in parent directories.]' \
        '--no-ignore-vcs[Don'\''t respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.). This implies --no-ignore-parent for VCS files. Note that .ignore files will continue to be respected.]' \
        {-N,--no-line-number}'[Suppress line numbers. This is enabled by default when not searching in a terminal.]' \
        '--no-messages[Suppress all error messages related to opening and reading files. Error messages related to the syntax of the pattern given are still shown.]' \
        '--no-mmap[Never use memory maps, even when they might be faster.]' \
        '--no-pcre2-unicode[DEPRECATED. Use --no-unicode instead.]' \
        '--no-require-git[By default, ripgrep will only respect global gitignore rules, .gitignore rules and local exclude rules if ripgrep detects that you are searching inside a git repository. This flag allows you to relax this restriction such that ripgrep will respect all git related ignore rules regardless of whether you'\''re searching in a git repository or not.]' \
        '--no-unicode[By default, ripgrep will enable "Unicode mode" in all of its regexes. This has a number of consequences:]' \
        {-0,--null}'[Whenever a file path is printed, follow it with a NUL byte. This includes printing file paths before matches, and when printing a list of matching files such as with --count, --files-with-matches and --files. This option is useful for use with xargs.]' \
        '--null-data[Enabling this option causes ripgrep to use NUL as a line terminator instead of the default of '\''\n'\''.]' \
        '--one-file-system[When enabled, ripgrep will not cross file system boundaries relative to where the search started from.]' \
        {-o,--only-matching}'[Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.]' \
        '--passthru[Print both matching and non-matching lines.]' \
        '--path-separator[Set the path separator to use when printing file paths. This defaults to your platform'\''s path separator, which is / on Unix and \ on Windows. This flag is intended for overriding the default when the environment demands it (e.g., cygwin). A path separator is limited to a single byte.]' \
        {-P,--pcre2}'[When this flag is present, ripgrep will use the PCRE2 regex engine instead of its default regex engine.]' \
        '--pcre2-version[When this flag is present, ripgrep will print the version of PCRE2 in use, along with other information, and then exit. If PCRE2 is not available, then ripgrep will print an error message and exit with an error code.]' \
        '--pre[For each input FILE, search the standard output of COMMAND FILE rather than the contents of FILE. This option expects the COMMAND program to either be an absolute path or to be available in your PATH. Either an empty string COMMAND or the '\''--no-pre'\'' flag will disable this behavior.]' \
        '--pre-glob[This flag works in conjunction with the --pre flag. Namely, when one or more --pre-glob flags are given, then only files that match the given set of globs will be handed to the command specified by the --pre flag. Any non-matching files will be searched without using the preprocessor command.]' \
        {-p,--pretty}'[This is a convenience alias for '\''--color always --heading --line-number'\''. This flag is useful when you still want pretty output even if you'\''re piping ripgrep to another program or file. For example: '\''rg -p foo | less -R'\''.]' \
        {-q,--quiet}'[Do not print anything to stdout. If a match is found in a file, then ripgrep will stop searching. This is useful when ripgrep is used only for its exit code (which will be an error if no matches are found).]' \
        '--regex-size-limit[The upper size limit of the compiled regex. The default limit is 10M.]' \
        {-e,--regexp}'[A pattern to search for. This option can be provided multiple times, where all patterns given are searched. Lines matching at least one of the provided patterns are printed. This flag can also be used when searching for patterns that start with a dash.]' \
        {-r,--replace}'[Replace every match with the text given when printing results. Neither this flag nor any other ripgrep flag will modify your files.]' \
        {-z,--search-zip}'[Search in compressed files. Currently gzip, bzip2, xz, LZ4, LZMA, Brotli and Zstd files are supported. This option expects the decompression binaries to be available in your PATH.]' \
        {-S,--smart-case}'[Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case sensitively otherwise.]' \
        '--sort[This flag enables sorting of results in ascending order. The possible values for this flag are:]' \
        '--sortr[This flag enables sorting of results in descending order. The possible values for this flag are:]' \
        '--stats[Print aggregate statistics about this ripgrep search. When this flag is present, ripgrep will print the following stats to stdout at the end of the search: number of matched lines, number of files with matches, number of files searched, and the time taken for the entire search to complete.]' \
        {-a,--text}'[Search binary files as if they were text. When this flag is present, ripgrep'\''s binary file detection is disabled. This means that when a binary file is searched, its contents may be printed if there is a match. This may cause escape codes to be printed that alter the behavior of your terminal.]' \
        {-j,--threads}'[The approximate number of threads to use. A value of 0 (which is the default) causes ripgrep to choose the thread count using heuristics.]' \
        '--trim[When set, all ASCII whitespace at the beginning of each line printed will be trimmed.]' \
        {-t,--type}'[Only search files matching TYPE. Multiple type flags may be provided. Use the --type-list flag to list all available types.]' \
        '--type-add[Add a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can be added at a time. Multiple --type-add flags can be provided. Unless --type-clear is used, globs are added to any existing globs defined inside of ripgrep.]' \
        '--type-clear[Clear the file type globs previously defined for TYPE. This only clears the default type definitions that are found inside of ripgrep.]' \
        '--type-list[Show all supported file types and their corresponding globs.]' \
        {-T,--type-not}'[Do not search files matching TYPE. Multiple type-not flags may be provided. Use the --type-list flag to list all available types.]' \
        {-u,--unrestricted}'[Reduce the level of "smart" searching. A single -u won'\''t respect .gitignore (etc.) files (--no-ignore). Two -u flags will additionally search hidden files and directories (-./--hidden). Three -u flags will additionally search binary files (--binary).]' \
        {-V,--version}'[Prints version information]' \
        '--vimgrep[Show results with every match on its own line, including line numbers and column numbers. With this option, a line with more than one match will be printed more than once.]' \
        {-H,--with-filename}'[Display the file path for matches. This is the default when more than one file is searched. If --heading is enabled (the default when printing to a terminal), the file path will be shown above clusters of matches from each file; otherwise, the file name will be shown as a prefix for each matched line.]' \
        {-w,--word-regexp}'[Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries. This is roughly equivalent to putting \b before and after all of the search patterns.]' \
