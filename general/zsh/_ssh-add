        '-D[Deletes all identities from the agent.]' \
        '-d[Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent. If ssh-add has been run without arguments, the keys for the default identities and their corresponding certificates will be removed. Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certificates to be removed from the agent. If no public key is found at a given path, ssh-add will append .pub and retry. If the argument list consists of “-” then ssh-add will read public keys to be removed from standard input.]' \
        '-E[Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are: “md5” and “sha256”. The default is “sha256”.]' \
        '-e[Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library pkcs11.]' \
        '-H[Specifies a known hosts file to look up hostkeys when using destination-constrained keys via the -h flag. This option may be specified multiple times to allow multiple files to be searched. If no files are specified, ssh-add will use the default ssh_config(5) known hosts files: ~/.ssh/known_hosts, ~/.ssh/known_hosts2, /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2.]':file:_files \

        '-L[Lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented by the agent.]' \
        '-l[Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the agent.]' \
        '-q[Be quiet after a successful operation.]' \
        '-S[Specifies a path to a library that will be used when adding FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the internal USB HID support.]' \
        '-s[Add keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library pkcs11.]' \
        '-T[Tests whether the private keys that correspond to the specified pubkey files are usable by performing sign and verify operations on each.]' \
        '-t[Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent. The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format specified in sshd_config(5).]' \
        '-v[Verbose mode. Causes ssh-add to print debugging messages about its progress. This is helpful in debugging problems. Multiple -v options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3.]' \
