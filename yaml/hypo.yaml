options:
  - names:
      - -r
      - --reads-short
    argument: <str>

      - --draft
    argument: <str>
    description: Input file name containing the draft contigs (in fasta/fastq format; can be compressed).
  - names:

      - --bam-sr
    argument: <str>
    description: Input file name containing the alignments of short reads against the draft (in bam/sam format; must have CIGAR information).
  - names:

      - --processing-size
    argument: <int>
    description: Number of contigs to be processed in one batch. Lower value means less memory usage but slower speed. [Default] All the contigs in the draft.
